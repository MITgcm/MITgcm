  These lines are here to deliberately cause a compile-time error.
  If you see these lines in your .F files or the compiler shows them
  as an error then it means you have not placed your configuration
  files in the appropriate place.
  You need to place you own copy of SIZE.h in the include
  path for the model, and comment out these lines.

C     *==========================================================*
C     | SIZE.h Declare size of underlying computational grid.     
C     *==========================================================*
C     | The design here support a three-dimensional model grid    
C     | with indices I,J and K. The three-dimensional domain      
C     | is comprised of nPx*nSx blocks of size sNx along one axis 
C     | nPy*nSy blocks of size sNy along another axis and one     
C     | block of size Nz along the final axis.                    
C     | Blocks have overlap regions of size OLx and OLy along the 
C     | dimensions that are subdivided.
