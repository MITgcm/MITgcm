CEOP

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C-- Forcing code options:

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option
#define SHORTWAVE_HEATING

C o Include/exclude Geothermal Heat Flux at the bottom of the ocean
#undef ALLOW_GEOTHERMAL_FLUX

C o Allow to account for heating due to friction (and momentum dissipation)
#undef ALLOW_FRICTION_HEATING

C o Allow mass source or sink of Fluid in the interior
C   (3-D generalisation of oceanic real-fresh water flux)
#undef ALLOW_ADDFLUID

C o Include pressure loading code
#define ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing fluxes code
#define ALLOW_BALANCE_FLUXES

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing relaxation code
#define ALLOW_BALANCE_RELAX

C o Include/exclude checking for negative salinity
#undef CHECK_SALINITY_FOR_NEGATIVE_VALUES

C-- Options to discard parts of the main code:

C o Exclude/allow external forcing-fields load
C   this allows to read & do simple linear time interpolation of oceanic
C   forcing fields, if no specific pkg (e.g., EXF) is used to compute them.
#undef EXCLUDE_FFIELDS_LOAD

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code
#define INCLUDE_PHIHYD_CALCULATION_CODE

C-- Vertical mixing code options:

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT
#define INCLUDE_CONVECT_CALL

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY
#define INCLUDE_CALC_DIFFUSIVITY_CALL

C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity
#undef ALLOW_3D_DIFFKR

C o Allow latitudinally varying BryanLewis79 vertical diffusivity
#undef ALLOW_BL79_LAT_VARY

C o Exclude/allow partial-cell effect (physical or enhanced) in vertical mixing
C   this allows to account for partial-cell in vertical viscosity and diffusion,
C   either from grid-spacing reduction effect or as artificially enhanced mixing
C   near surface & bottom for too thin grid-cell
#undef EXCLUDE_PCELL_MIX_CODE

C-- Time-stepping code options:

C o Include/exclude combined Surf.Pressure and Drag Implicit solver code
#define ALLOW_SOLVE4_PS_AND_DRAG

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code
#define INCLUDE_IMPLVERTADV_CODE

C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code
#undef ALLOW_ADAMSBASHFORTH_3

C-- Model formulation options:

C o Allow/exclude "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   that ensures that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport
#define EXACT_CONSERV

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that grid-cell thickness (hFactors) varies with time
#define NONLIN_FRSURF

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code
#define ALLOW_NONHYDROSTATIC

C o Include/exclude GM-like eddy stress in momentum code
#undef ALLOW_EDDYPSI

C-- Algorithm options:

C o Use Non Self-Adjoint (NSA) conjugate-gradient solver
#undef ALLOW_CG2D_NSA

C o Include/exclude code for single reduction Conjugate-Gradient solver
#define ALLOW_SRCG

C o Choices for implicit solver routines solve_*diagonal.F
C   The following has low memory footprint, but not suitable for AD
#undef SOLVE_DIAGONAL_LOWMEMORY
C   The following one suitable for AD but does not vectorize
#undef SOLVE_DIAGONAL_KINNER

C-- Retired code options:

C o Use LONG.bin, LATG.bin, etc., initialization for ini_curviliear_grid.F
C   Default is to use "new" grid files (OLD_GRID_IO undef) but OLD_GRID_IO
C   is still useful with, e.g., single-domain curvilinear configurations.
#undef OLD_GRID_IO

C-- Other option files:

C o Execution environment support options
#include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"

C o Include/exclude single header file containing multiple packages options
C   (AUTODIFF, COST, CTRL, ECCO, EXF ...) instead of the standard way where
C   each of the above pkg get its own options from its specific option file.
C   Although this method, inherited from ECCO setup, has been traditionally
C   used for all adjoint built, work is in progress to allow to use the
C   standard method also for adjoint built.
