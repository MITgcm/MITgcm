This set of matlab scripts and functions does some basic diagnostics on the
global ocean run. By no means are they meant to be universal or exhaustive. 
Use them as a starting point for your own diagnostics.

After including this directory into your matlab path, 
change into the directory where the model output is and type at the matlab
prompt:
matlab>> mit_loadglobal
to get a number of plots of meridional overturning stream functions, 
barotropic streamfunctions, surface fluxes of heat and freshwater, model 
drift, devations of model hydrography from levitus etc. 
By default the script will look for time-averaged fields. If there are not 
any time averaged fields, type 
matlab>> meanfields = 0;
at the matlab prompt before runing the scripts so that the latest snapshot
fields are displayed instead.
