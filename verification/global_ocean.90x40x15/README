Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
 [make Clean]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ../input/prepare_run
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in the directory:
  results/output.txt

There is comparison output in directory:
  (verification/global_ocean.90x40x1/) results

Comments:
o The input data is real*4.
o The surface fluxes are derived from monthly means of the NCEP climatology;
  - a matlab script is provided that created the surface flux data files from
    the original NCEP data: ncep2global_ocean.m in the diags_matlab directory,
    needs editing to adjust search paths.
o matlab scripts that make a simple diagnostic (barotropic stream function,
  overturning stream functions, averaged hydrography etc.) is provided in
  verification/tutorial_global_oce_latlon/diags_matlab:
  - mit_loadglobal is the toplevel script that run all other scripts
  - mit_globalmovie animates theta, salinity, and 3D-velocity field for
    a layer "iz", if "meanfields=0"

============================================
Use of "blank tiles" in conjunction with exch2 package:
============================================

This verification experiment also demonstrate the omission of tiles
(or processors) for tiles that are fully land cover and don't need computation.
The relevant config. files to be manipulated are:
* at compile time, in dir. code/: packages.conf, SIZE.h
* at run time, in dir. input/: data.exch2

To enable this feature requires package "exch2"
(see Section 6.2.4 "exch2: Extended Cubed Sphere Topology" of online manual),
i.e. in code/packages.conf add "exch2"

The basic layout of the experiment is Nx*Ny = 90x40.
In a single-processor config. with very small tile sizes (sNx*sNy=10*10)
this can be represented, e.g. via
     &           sNx =  10,
     &           sNy =  10,
     &           OLx =   3,
     &           OLy =   3,
     &           nSx =   9,
     &           nSy =   4,
     &           nPx =   1,
     &           nPy =   1,
i.e. we use nSx*nSy=9*4=36 virtual processors.

An equivalent parallel setup using 9 virtual and 4 real processors
would look like:
     &           sNx =  10,
     &           sNy =  10,
     &           OLx =   3,
     &           OLy =   3,
     &           nSx =   9,
     &           nSy =   1,
     &           nPx =   1,
     &           nPy =   4,

In this layout it turns out that tile number 30 is "empty", i.e. fully land covered.
We wish to remove this tile from our calculation. How to proceed?

1. Find out which tiles to eliminate via a config. that uses all tiles
---
1.1. At compile time:
* add line "exch2" to packages.conf
* configure SIZE.h using your desired individual tile size, e.g. sNx*sNy=10*10, as follows:
     &           sNx =  10,
     &           sNy =  10,
     &           OLx =   3,
     &           OLy =   3,
     &           nSx =   9,
     &           nSy =   1,
     &           nPx =   1,
     &           nPy =   4,
  As described above you are using 4 real processors with 9 virtual tiles per processor.
* compile (don't forget to compile via -mpi or similar)

1.2 At runtime:
* need to reflect your basic layout in data.exch2
  This is simple: since you are not using any non-trivial topology with
  multiple facets (such as cubed-sphere),
  you only need to specify one basic facet (Nx,Ny)=(90,40) layout via following line:
  dimsFacets = 90, 40,
  Then run the moodel, e.g. via:
  mpirun -np 4 ./mitgcmuv

1.3 Diagnose which tile numbers are empty:
* from STDOUT.000[0-3] you can infer which tiles are empty using following grep:
  grep "Empty tile" STDOUT.* | awk '{print "  " $6 ","}' > empty_tiles.txt 
* In this example there's only one empty tile, and it is #30.

2. Configuring with empty tiles removed
---
2.1 At compile time:
   We've determined that 1 out of nSx*nPx*nSy*nPy=36 tiles is empty and can be removed,
   leaving 36-1=35 non-empty tiles. We are free to re-order nSx,nPx,nSy,nPy in any way,
   as long as nSx*nPx*nSy*nPy=35. Here's how it's chosen in the verif. experiment
   (see file SIZE.h_mpi)
     &           sNx =  10,
     &           sNy =  10,
     &           OLx =   3,
     &           OLy =   3,
     &           nSx =   7,
     &           nSy =   1,
     &           nPx =   1,
     &           nPy =   5,
   and for which, as required nSx*nPx*nSy*nPy=35

2.2 At runtime:
We now need to specify in data.exch2 the number of the empty tile to be removed.
This is done as follows (see file data.exch2.mpi):
  blankList  = 30,
If there were more empty tiles, this would be a more extensive index array, e.g.
  blankList = tile1, tile2, tile3, ... 
Now run the model (note that we've selected nPy=5, so in this example we actually
*increase* the number of "real" processors used, despite reducing the number of
total, i.e. "real" plus virtual tiles from 36 to 35):
mpirun -np 5 ./mitgcmuv
