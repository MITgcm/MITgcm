See [Chapter 4](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html#) of the online documentation for instructions to build, run, and analyze output from MITgcm Tutorial Example Experiments.

A list of additional verification experiments in this directory, with brief description, is presented for forward model setups [here](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html#subsec-add-expts-fwd) and for adjoint model setups [here](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html#subsec-add-expts-adj).
