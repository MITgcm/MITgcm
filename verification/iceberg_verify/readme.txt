Verification for ICEBERG
This is a relatively lightweight model to showcase the ICEBERG package. 1 week of runtime is needed to create obvious changes in T/S and ocean flow, but for actual automated validation it can likely be much shorter. I have included the output in 'results' as well a number of animations of the results.

Additionally, some PNGs are available in 'input' to help visualize the setup. The full python script for generating this model configuration is available there, but fair warning it will not fully work for you as it requires some custom built python packages I have not included here. It should still make the binary input files for you, but it won't generate files like data.diagnostics file for instance, so you will have to update those manually if you make any adjustments. 

The mitgcmuv built in this exp was build to run on Mac OS 14.8.1 (23J30) with M3 chip. Re-compilation maybe needed on other machines. 

Feel free to reach out with specific questions.
