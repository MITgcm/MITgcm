Example: Labrador Sea Region with Sea-Ice
=========================================

This example sets up a small (20x16x23) Labrador Sea experiment
coupled to a dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model.
A brief description of the sea-ice model is in "seaice.ps".

The domain of integration spans 280E to 320E and 46N to 78N.
Horizontal grid spacing is 2 degrees.
The 23 vertical levels and the bathymetry file
  bathyFile      = 'bathy.labsea'
are obtained from the the 2-degree ECCO configuration.

Integration is initialized from annual-mean Levitus climatology
 hydrogThetaFile = 'LevCli_temp.labsea'
 hydrogSaltFile  = 'LevCli_salt.labsea'

Surface salinity relaxation is to the monthly mean Levitus climatology
 saltClimFile    = 'SSS.labsea'

Forcing files are a 1979-1999 monthly climatology computed from the
NCEP reanalysis (see pkg/seaice/SEAICE_FFIELDS.h for units and signs)
  gairxFile      = 'u10m.labsea79'    # 10-m zonal wind
  gairyFile      = 'v10m.labsea79'    # 10-m meridional wind
  tairFile       = 'tair.labsea1979'  # 2-m air temperature
  qaFile         = 'qa.labsea1979'    # 2-m specific humidity
  floFile        = 'flo.labsea1979'   # longwave radiation
  fshFile        = 'fsh.labsea1979'   # shortwave radiation
  rainFile       = 'prate.labsea1979' # precipitation
  evapFile       = 'evap.labsea1979'  # evaporation


Using testscript to test sea-ice code
=====================================

Running the testscript experiment:
  cd verification
  ./testscript -force lab_sea

Note that fairly large differences in accuracy occur across different
platforms.  For example, testscript comparisons between g77 (Linux)
and f77 (SGI) generated output gives:

   T           S           U           V
  C D M    c        m  s        m  s        m  s        m  s
  n p a R  g  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .
  f n k u  2  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d

  ln -sf ../code/SIZE.h .
  ln -sf ../code/CPP_OPTIONS.h .
  ln -sf ../code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h .

  ln -sf ../code/CPP_EEOPTIONS_MPI.h CPP_EEOPTIONS.h

  make clean

  mv mitgcmuv mitgcmuv_2x1


Instructions for running Experiment 1
=====================================

This is a 1-cpu, 10-hour integration used to make sure that all the
files are available and that the model compiles and integrates.  It
is the default experiment of "verification/testscript lab_sea".

To run Experiment 1:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.10hours data
  ln -sf data.seaice.adi data.seaice
  mitgcmuv_1 >&! output.txt
  mkdir exp1
  mv *tave.0000000010.data exp1

Use matlab script lookat_exp1.m to compare the output
of exp1 with that from release1_patch5 sea-ice code:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp1


Instructions for running Experiment 2
=====================================

This is a 1-cpu test of the LSR solver.  The solution is
compared to that of experiment 1, which used the ADI solver.

To run Experiment 2:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.10hours data
  ln -sf data.seaice.lsr data.seaice
  mitgcmuv_1 >&! output.txt
  mkdir exp2
  mv *tave.0000000010.data exp2

Use matlab script lookat_exp2.m to compare
the output of exp2 to that of exp1:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp2


Instructions for running Experiment 3
=====================================

This is a test of periodic boundary conditions for LSR
and ADI solvers.  The domain has a flat bottom and
is periodic both in the x and the y directions.
All forcing files are null or constant (u10m = v10m = 5 m/s).

To run Experiment 3:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.1hour data
  ln -sf data.seaice.testadi data.seaice
  mitgcmuv_1 >&! output.txt
  mkdir exp3a
  mv *tave.0000000001.data exp3a
  ln -sf data.seaice.testlsr data.seaice
  mitgcmuv_1 >&! output.txt
  mkdir exp3b
  mv *tave.0000000001.data exp3b

Use matlab script lookat_exp3.m to compare
the output of exp2 to that of exp1:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp3

If the dynamic ice solvers are correct, they should converge to a
constant solution.  The tests above show that both the ADI and the LSR
solver are unable to handle periodic domains and therefore that they
cannot be "correctly" parallelized.


Instructions for running Experiment 4
=====================================

This is a 2-cpu, 10-hour integration used to test
tile edges for sea-ice dynamic solvers.

To run Experiment 4:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.10hours data
  ln -sf data.seaice.adi data.seaice
  mpirun -np 2 mitgcmuv_2x1
  mkdir exp4
  mv *tave.0000000010.data exp4

Use the matlab script lookat_exp4.m to compare
the 2-cpu output to that of exp1:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp4

The inaccuracy at the tile boundary can be decreased by increasing
NPSEUDO in data.seaice at the expense of computation time.
Also as sea-ice ages (thickens) the difference at the tiles becomes
increasingly small.  For solver pkg/seaice/adi.F a value of NPSEUDO=10
appears adequate for forward integrations but cannot be used for sea-ice
adjoint model.  Work is underway to fix this problem.


Instructions for running Experiment 5
=====================================

This is a 2-cpu, 2-year, test integration.  It illustrates
convention used by seaice_get_forcing.F for multi-year forcing.

To run Experiment 5:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf      data.2years             data
  ln -sf  data.seaice.adi      data.seaice
  ln -sf  evap.labsea1979  evap.labsea1980  
  ln -sf   flo.labsea1979   flo.labsea1980   
  ln -sf   fsh.labsea1979   fsh.labsea1980   
  ln -sf prate.labsea1979 prate.labsea1980 
  ln -sf    qa.labsea1979    qa.labsea1980    
  ln -sf  tair.labsea1979  tair.labsea1980  
  ln -sf    u10m.labsea79    u10m.labsea80    
  ln -sf    v10m.labsea79    v10m.labsea80    
  mpirun -np 2 mitgcmuv_2x1

Use the matlab script lookat_exp5.m to compare
the 2-cpu output to SMMR-SSM/I data:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp5

Disclaimer:
The comparison here is just for fun, not really supposed
to look anything like the data.
Otherwise it would put a lot of people out of business :-)

Instructions for running Experiment 6
=====================================

This is a 1-cpu test of sea-ice thermodynamics (no dynamics).
The solution is compared to that of experiment 1.

To run Experiment 6:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.10hours data
  ln -sf data.seaice.nodynamics data.seaice
  mitgcmuv_1 >&! output.txt
  mkdir exp6
  mv *tave.0000000010.data exp6

Use the matlab script lookat_exp6.m to compare
the output of exp6 to that of exp1:
  cd ../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp6

Instructions for running Experiment 7
=====================================

This is a 2-cpu, 10-hour integration used to test
tile edges for sea-ice thermodynamics (no dynamics).
2-CPU executable from experiment 4 is required.

To run Experiment 7:
  cd ../../../verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf data.10hours data
  ln -sf data.seaice.nodynamics data.seaice
  mpirun -np 2 mitgcmuv_2x1
  mkdir exp7
  mv *tave.0000000010.data exp7

Use the matlab script lookat_exp7.m to compare
the output of exp7 to that of exp6:
  cd ../verification/lab_sea/matlab
  matlab
  lookat_exp7
