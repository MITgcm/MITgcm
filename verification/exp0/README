Example: "Barotropic double-gyre"
=================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
  cp ../verification/exp0/code/SIZE.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/exp0/code/CPP_OPTIONS.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/exp0/code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h ../eesupp/inc/

Configure and compile the code:
  cd bin
  ../tools/genmake -makefile
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd ../exe
  cp ../verification/exp0/input/* .
  ./mitgcmuv

There is comparison output in the directory:
 ../verification/exp0/results

Comments:
The input data is real*8 and generated using the MATLAB script
gendata.m.
