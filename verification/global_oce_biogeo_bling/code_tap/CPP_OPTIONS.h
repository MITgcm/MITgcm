C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option
#define SHORTWAVE_HEATING

C o Include/exclude Geothermal Heat Flux at the bottom of the ocean
#undef ALLOW_GEOTHERMAL_FLUX

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code
#define INCLUDE_PHIHYD_CALCULATION_CODE

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT
#define INCLUDE_CONVECT_CALL

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY
#define INCLUDE_CALC_DIFFUSIVITY_CALL

C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity
#undef ALLOW_3D_DIFFKR

C o Allow latitudinally varying BryanLewis79 vertical diffusivity
#undef ALLOW_BL79_LAT_VARY

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code
#define INCLUDE_IMPLVERTADV_CODE

C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code
#define ALLOW_ADAMSBASHFORTH_3

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code
#undef ALLOW_NONHYDROSTATIC

C o Allow to account for heating due to friction (and momentum dissipation)
#undef ALLOW_FRICTION_HEATING

C o Allow mass source or sink of Fluid in the interior
C   (3-D generalisation of oceanic real-fresh water flux)
#undef ALLOW_ADDFLUID

C o Include pressure loading code
#define ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING

C o exclude/allow external forcing-fields load
C   this allows to read & do simple linear time interpolation of oceanic
C   forcing fields, if no specific pkg (e.g., EXF) is used to compute them.
#undef EXCLUDE_FFIELDS_LOAD

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing fluxes code
#undef ALLOW_BALANCE_FLUXES

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing relaxation code
#undef ALLOW_BALANCE_RELAX

C o Include/exclude GM-like eddy stress in momentum code
#undef ALLOW_EDDYPSI

C o Use "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   so that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport
#undef EXACT_CONSERV

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that surface thickness (hFactors) vary with time
#undef NONLIN_FRSURF
#undef DISABLE_RSTAR_CODE
#define DISABLE_SIGMA_CODE

C o Include/exclude code for single reduction Conjugate-Gradient solver
#undef ALLOW_SRCG

C o Choices for implicit solver routines solve_*diagonal.F
C   The following has low memory footprint, but not suitable for AD
#undef SOLVE_DIAGONAL_LOWMEMORY
C   The following one suitable for AD but does not vectorize
#define SOLVE_DIAGONAL_KINNER

C o ALLOW isotropic scaling of harmonic and bi-harmonic terms when
C   using an locally isotropic spherical grid with (dlambda) x (dphi*cos(phi))
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C   The preferred method is specifying a value for viscAhGrid or viscA4Grid
C   in data which is then automatically scaled by the grid size;
C   the old method of specifying viscAh/viscA4 and this flag is provided
C   for completeness only (and for use with the adjoint).
C#define ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING

C o This flag selects the form of COSINE(lat) scaling of bi-harmonic term.
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Has no effect if ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING is undefined.
C   Has no effect on vector invariant momentum equations.
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C#define COSINEMETH_III

C o Use "OLD" UV discretisation near boundaries (*not* recommended)
C   Note - only works with pkg/mom_fluxform and "no_slip_sides=.FALSE."
C          because the old code did not have no-slip BCs
#undef OLD_ADV_BCS

C o Use LONG.bin, LATG.bin, etc., initialization for ini_curviliear_grid.F
C   Default is to use "new" grid files (OLD_GRID_IO undef) but OLD_GRID_IO
C   is still useful with, e.g., single-domain curvilinear configurations.
#undef OLD_GRID_IO

C o Use old EXTERNAL_FORCING_U,V,T,S subroutines (for backward compatibility)
#undef USE_OLD_EXTERNAL_FORCING

#define EXCLUDE_PCELL_MIX_CODE

C o Execution environment support options
#include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"

#endif /* CPP_OPTIONS_H */
