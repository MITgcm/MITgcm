#ifndef CPP_OPTIONS_H

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option
#undef SHORTWAVE_HEATING

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code
#define INCLUDE_PHIHYD_CALCULATION_CODE

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT
#define INCLUDE_CONVECT_CALL

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY
#define INCLUDE_CALC_DIFFUSIVITY_CALL

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code
#define INCLUDE_IMPLVERTADV_CODE

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code
#define ALLOW_NONHYDROSTATIC

C o Include pressure loading code
#define ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING

C o Use "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   so that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport
#define EXACT_CONSERV

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that surface thickness (hFactors) vary with time
#undef NONLIN_FRSURF

C o Use "OLD" UV discretisation near boundaries (*not* recommended)
C   Note - only works with  #undef NO_SLIP_LATERAL  in calc_mom_rhs.F
C          because the old code did not have no-slip BCs
#undef  OLD_ADV_BCS

C o Execution environment support options
#include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"

C o Include/exclude code specific to the ECCO/SEALION version.
C   AUTODIFF or EXF package.
C   Currently controled by a single header file
C   For this to work, PACKAGES_CONFIG.h needs to be included!
cph#if (defined (ALLOW_AUTODIFF) || \
cph     defined (ALLOW_ECCO) || \
cph     defined (ALLOW_EXF))
cph# include "ECCO_CPPOPTIONS.h"
