C     *==========================================================*
C     | SIZE.h Declare size of underlying computational grid.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | The design here supports a three-dimensional model grid
C     | with indices I,J and K. The three-dimensional domain
C     | is comprised of nPx*nSx blocks (or tiles) of size sNx
C     | along the first (left-most index) axis, nPy*nSy blocks
C     | of size sNy along the second axis and one block of size
C     | Nr along the vertical (third) axis.
C     | Blocks/tiles have overlap regions of size OLx and OLy
C     | along the dimensions that are subdivided.

C     Voodoo numbers controlling data layout:
C     sNx :: Number of X points in tile.
C     sNy :: Number of Y points in tile.
C     OLx :: Tile overlap extent in X.
C     OLy :: Tile overlap extent in Y.
C     nSx :: Number of tiles per process in X.
C     nSy :: Number of tiles per process in Y.
C     nPx :: Number of processes to use in X.
C     nPy :: Number of processes to use in Y.
C     Nx  :: Number of points in X for the full domain.
C     Ny  :: Number of points in Y for the full domain.
C     Nr  :: Number of points in vertical direction.
