C *==================================================================*
CEOP

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C-- Forcing code options:

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in APPLY_FORCING_T (apply_forcing.F)


C o Include/exclude Geothermal Heat Flux at the bottom of the ocean


C o Allow to account for heating due to friction (and momentum dissipation)


C o Allow mass source or sink of Fluid in the interior
C   (3-D generalisation of oceanic real-fresh water flux)


C o Include pressure loading code


C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing fluxes code


C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing relaxation code


C o Include/exclude checking for negative salinity


C-- Options to discard parts of the main code:

C o Exclude/allow external forcing-fields load
C   this allows to read & do simple linear time interpolation of oceanic
C   forcing fields, if no specific pkg (e.g., EXF) is used to compute them.

C   If defined, use same method (with pkg/autodiff compiled or not) for checking
C   when to load new reccord ; by default, use simpler method with pkg/autodiff.


C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code


C o Include/exclude sound speed calculation code
C o (Note that this is a diagnostic from Del Grasso algorithm, not derived
C    from EOS)


C-- Vertical mixing code options:

C o Include/exclude calling S/R CONVECTIVE_ADJUSTMENT


C o Include/exclude calling S/R CONVECTIVE_ADJUSTMENT_INI, turned off by
C   default because it is an unpopular historical left-over


C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY


C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity


C o Allow latitudinally varying BryanLewis79 vertical diffusivity


C o Exclude/allow partial-cell effect (physical or enhanced) in vertical mixing
C   this allows to account for partial-cell in vertical viscosity and diffusion,
C   either from grid-spacing reduction effect or as artificially enhanced mixing
C   near surface & bottom for too thin grid-cell


C o Exclude/allow to use isotropic 3-D Smagorinsky viscosity as diffusivity
C   for tracers (after scaling by constant Prandtl number)


C-- Time-stepping code options:

C o Include/exclude combined Surf.Pressure and Drag Implicit solver code


C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code


C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code


C o Include/exclude Quasi-Hydrostatic Stagger Time-step AdamsBashforth code


C-- Model formulation options:

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that grid-cell thickness (hFactors) varies with time

C o Disable code for rStar coordinate and/or code for Sigma coordinate
c#define DISABLE_RSTAR_CODE
c#define DISABLE_SIGMA_CODE

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code


C o Include/exclude GM-like eddy stress in momentum code


C-- Algorithm options:

C o Include/exclude code for Non Self-Adjoint (NSA) conjugate-gradient solver


C o Include/exclude code for single reduction Conjugate-Gradient solver


C o Choices for implicit solver routines solve_*diagonal.F
C   The following has low memory footprint, but not suitable for AD

C   The following one suitable for AD but does not vectorize


C   Implementation alternative (might be faster on some platforms ?)


C-- Retired code options:

C-  These 2 flags: ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING & COSINEMETH_III have no effect
C   here as they are reset in GAD_OPTIONS.h and in MOM_COMMON_OPTIONS.h
C   for tracer diffusivity and momentum viscosity respectively

C o Use "OLD" UV discretisation near boundaries (*not* recommended)
C   Note - only works with pkg/mom_fluxform and "no_slip_sides=.FALSE."
C          because the old code did not have no-slip BCs


C o Use LONG.bin, LATG.bin, etc., initialization for ini_curviliear_grid.F
C   Default is to use "new" grid files (OLD_GRID_IO undef) but OLD_GRID_IO
C   is still useful with, e.g., single-domain curvilinear configurations.


C o Use old EXTERNAL_FORCING_U,V,T,S subroutines (for backward compatibility)


C-- Other option files:

C o Execution environment support options

C     | CPP\_EEOPTIONS.h                                         |
C     *==========================================================*
C     | C preprocessor "execution environment" supporting        |
C     | flags. Use this file to set flags controlling the        |
C     | execution environment in which a model runs - as opposed |
C     | to the dynamical problem the model solves.               |
C     | Note: Many options are implemented with both compile time|
C     |       and run-time switches. This allows options to be   |
C     |       removed altogether, made optional at run-time or   |
C     |       to be permanently enabled. This convention helps   |
C     |       with the data-dependence analysis performed by the |
C     |       adjoint model compiler. This data dependency       |
C     |       analysis can be upset by runtime switches that it  |
C     |       is unable to recoginise as being fixed for the     |
C     |       duration of an integration.                        |
C     |       A reasonable way to use these flags is to          |
C     |       set all options as selectable at runtime but then  |
C     |       once an experimental configuration has been        |
C     |       identified, rebuild the code with the appropriate  |
C     |       options set at compile time.                       |
C     *==========================================================*
CEOP

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C=== Macro related options ===
C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working set size.
C     However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades performance.
C     Enable to switch REAL4_IS_SLOW from genmake2 (with LET_RS_BE_REAL4):


C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use D0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16


C=== IO related options ===
C--   Flag used to indicate whether Fortran formatted write
C     and read are threadsafe. On SGI the routines can be thread
C     safe, on Sun it is not possible - if you are unsure then
C     undef this option.


C--   Flag used to indicate whether Binary write to Local file (i.e.,
C     a different file for each tile) and read are thread-safe.


C--   Flag to turn off the writing of error message to ioUnit zero


C--   Flag to turn on old default of opening scratch files with the
C     STATUS='SCRATCH' option. This method, while perfectly FORTRAN-standard,
C     caused filename conflicts on some multi-node/multi-processor platforms
C     in the past and has been replace by something (hopefully) more robust.


C--   Flag defined for eeboot_minimal.F, eeset_parms.F and open_copy_data_file.F
C     to write STDOUT, STDERR and scratch files from process 0 only.
C WARNING: to use only when absolutely confident that the setup is working
C     since any message (error/warning/print) from any proc <> 0 will be lost.


C=== MPI, EXCH and GLOBAL_SUM related options ===
C--   Flag turns off MPI_SEND ready_to_receive polling in the
C     gather_* subroutines to speed up integrations.


C--   Control MPI based parallel processing
CXXX We no longer select the use of MPI via this file (CPP_EEOPTIONS.h)
CXXX To use MPI, use an appropriate genmake2 options file or use
CXXX genmake2 -mpi .
CXXX #undef  ALLOW_USE_MPI

C--   Control use of communication that might overlap computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "non-blocking" sends and receives.

C--   Control use of communication that is atomic to computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "blocking" sends and receives.


C--   Control XY periodicity in processor to grid mappings
C     Note: Model code does not need to know whether a domain is
C           periodic because it has overlap regions for every box.
C           Model assume that these values have been
C           filled in some way.


C--   disconnect tiles (no exchange between tiles, just fill-in edges
C     assuming locally periodic subdomain)


C--   Always cumulate tile local-sum in the same order by applying MPI allreduce
C     to array of tiles ; can get slower with large number of tiles (big set-up)


C--   Alternative way of doing global sum without MPI allreduce call
C     but instead, explicit MPI send & recv calls. Expected to be slower.


C--   Alternative way of doing global sum on a single CPU
C     to eliminate tiling-dependent roundoff errors. Note: This is slow.


C=== Other options (to add/remove pieces of code) ===
C--   Flag to turn on checking for errors from all threads and procs
C     (calling S/R STOP_IF_ERROR) before stopping.


C--   Control use of communication with other component:
C     allow to import and export from/to Coupler interface.


C--   Activate some pieces of code for coupling to GEOS AGCM


C=== And define Macros ===

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C     Flag used to indicate which flavour of multi-threading
C     compiler directives to use. Only set one of these.
C     USE_SOLARIS_THREADING  - Takes directives for SUN Workshop
C                              compiler.
C     USE_KAP_THREADING      - Takes directives for Kuck and
C                              Associates multi-threading compiler
C                              ( used on Digital platforms ).
C     USE_IRIX_THREADING     - Takes directives for SGI MIPS
C                              Pro Fortran compiler.
C     USE_EXEMPLAR_THREADING - Takes directives for HP SPP series
C                              compiler.
C     USE_C90_THREADING      - Takes directives for CRAY/SGI C90
C                              system F90 compiler.












C--   Define the mapping for the _BARRIER macro
C     On some systems low-level hardware support can be accessed through
C     compiler directives here.


C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_CRIT() and  END_CRIT() macros.
C     On some systems we simply execute this section only using the
C     master thread i.e. its not really a critical section. We can
C     do this because we do not use critical sections in any critical
C     sections of our code!


C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_MASTER_SECTION() and
C     END_MASTER_SECTION() macros. These are generally implemented by
C     simply choosing a particular thread to be "the master" and have
C     it alone execute the BEGIN_MASTER..., END_MASTER.. sections.


CcnhDebugStarts
C      Alternate form to the above macros that increments (decrements) a counter each
C      time a MASTER section is entered (exited). This counter can then be checked in barrier
C      to try and detect calls to BARRIER within single threaded sections.
C      Using these macros requires two changes to Makefile - these changes are written
C      below.
C      1 - add a filter to the CPP command to kill off commented _MASTER lines
C      2 - add a filter to the CPP output the converts the string N EWLINE to an actual newline.
C      The N EWLINE needs to be changes to have no space when this macro and Makefile changes
C      are used. Its in here with a space to stop it getting parsed by the CPP stage in these
C      comments.
C      #define IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  N EWLINE      CALL BARRIER_MS(a)
C      #define ENDIF    CALL BARRIER_MU(a) N EWLINE        ENDIF
C      'CPP = cat $< | $(TOOLSDIR)/set64bitConst.sh |  grep -v '^[cC].*_MASTER' | cpp  -traditional -P'
C      .F.f:
C      $(CPP) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES) |  sed 's/N EWLINE/\n/' > $@
CcnhDebugEnds

C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working
C     set size. However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades
C     performance.
C- Note: global_sum/max macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete);
C  in addition, since only the R4 & R8 S/R are coded, GLOBAL RS & RL macros
C  enable to call the corresponding R4 or R8 S/R.






C- Note: a) exch macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete)
C        b) exch R4 & R8 macros are not practically used ; if needed,
C           will directly call the corrresponding S/R.


C--   Control use of JAM routines for Artic network (no longer supported)
C     These invoke optimized versions of "exchange" and "sum" that
C     utilize the programmable aspect of Artic cards.
CXXX No longer supported ; started to remove JAM routines.
CXXX #ifdef LETS_MAKE_JAM
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b)
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b ) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #endif

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use d0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16


C--   Substitue for 1.D variables
C     Sun compilers do not use 8-byte precision for literals
C     unless .Dnn is specified. CRAY vector machines use 16-byte
C     precision when they see .Dnn which runs very slowly!


C--   Set the format for writing processor IDs, e.g. in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file. The default of I9.9 should work for
C     a long time (until we will use 10e10 processors and more)


C--   Set the format for writing ensemble task IDs in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file.


C--   Set ACTION= in OPEN instruction for input file (before doing IO)
C     leave it empty (if EXCLUDE_OPEN_ACTION) or set it to proper value






C-  Place where multi-pkg header file ECCO_CPPOPTIONS.h used to be included

C Routine now calls MDS_WRITE_FIELD, just a way to add 2 extra arguments
C to the argument list. The 1rst new argument is to make the difference between
C the vertical dimension (3rd dimension) of an array and the number of levels
C the output routine should process. This routine assumes they are the same.
C The 2nd new argument (useCurrentDir=.FALSE.) allows to write files to
C the "mdsioLocalDir" directory (if it is set).
