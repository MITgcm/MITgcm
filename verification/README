The experiments:

exp0 - single layer, double gyre (barotropic with free-surface).
exp1 - 4 layer, double gyre.
exp2 - 4x4 degree global simulation with steady climatological forcing.
exp3 - atmospheric configuration.
exp4 - flow over a Gaussian bump in open-water or channel with open
       boundaries.
exp5 - inhomogenously forced convection in a doubly periodic box.
