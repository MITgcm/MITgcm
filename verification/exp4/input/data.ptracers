# This set-up is supposed to mimic salinity. That is, initially
# PTRACER(:,:,:,1) is identical to salinity, except that
# 1) the default (i.e., not explicitly specified) open boundary conditions
# are different, so that PTRACER(:,:,:,1) evolves differently than salinity.
# 2) a weak relaxation is applied in the Eastern part of the channel (using rbcs).
