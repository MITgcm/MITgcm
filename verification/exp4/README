Example: "Flow over a bump with Open Boundaries and passive tracers"
====================================================================

default paths are (as used in testreport):
  set build_dir = ${cwd}/build
  set run_dir   = ${cwd}/run
  set ROOT      = ${cwd}/../../

Configure and compile the code:
  cd ${build_dir}
  ${ROOT}/tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd ${run_dir}
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ${build_dir}/mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in the directory:
 results      ( absolute path: ${run_dir}/../results )

Comments:
The input data is real*8.

This experiment is a channel with topography and four open
boundaries. Salinity is not dynamically active in this experiment
(linear equation of state with sBeta=0). Different kinds of open
boundary values are used: zonal (x-)velocity U is prescribed at all
open boundaries with values that are read from data files (specified
in data.obcs); meridional (y-)velocity V is set to zero on all
boundaries, and temperature to tRef(z), both in obcs_calc.F, this is
the default behavior; at the western boundary, salinity values are
used for salinity and one passive tracer in the same way. Salinity is
set to sLev at all other boundaries, while a (nearly) homogeneous
v.Neumann condition is applied to the passive tracer (the latter is
the default in obcs_calc.F), with a relaxation (using pkg rbcs) in
the Eastern part of the channel. Open boundary parameters are set in
data.obcs.
