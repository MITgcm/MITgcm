Seaice-only verification experiment in idealized periodic channel
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) main forward experiment (code, input)

  Re-entrant zonally periodic channel (80x42 grid points) with just level (Nr=1)
   uniform resolution (5.km, 10m), solid Southern boundary with triangular shape
   coastline ("bathy_3c.bin")

  Use seaice (dynamics & thermodynamics from pkg/thsice) with EXF (see data.pkg)
   with initial ice thickness of 0.2 m (but no snow)
   (thSIceThick_InitFile='const+20.bin', in "input/data.ice")
  Initial seaice concentration is 100 % everywhere
   (thSIceFract_InitFile='const100.bin', in "input/data.ice")
  and seaice is initially at rest.

  At runtime turn off time-stepping in 'data', PARM01, using:
    momStepping  = .FALSE.,
    saltStepping = .FALSE.,
    tempAdvection=.FALSE.,
  And just keep surface temp relaxation (tauRelax = 1 month) toward fixed SST:
   in data.exf :
  > climsstperiod      = 0.0,
  > climsstTauRelax    = 2592000.,
  >  climsstfile       = 'tocn.bin',

 Forcing:
  None of the forcing vary with time; Most of the input files have been
   generated using matlab script "input/gendata.m".
  SST relaxation field is uniform in X, parabolic function of Y with
   maximum close to Southern boundary.

  Atmospheric air temp is uniform in Y, and only vary with X (~sin(2.pi.x/Lx))
   with an amplitude of 4.K ('tair_4x.bin');
  Uses constant Relative Humidity (70%, file 'qa70_4x.bin')
  constant and uniform downward shortwave (100.W/m2, 'dsw_100.bin'),
                       downward longwave (250.W/m^2, 'dlw_250.bin'),
                       zonal wind (10.m/s, 'windx.bin'),
  no meridional wind, no precip.

  Ocean surface currents comes from a 3 levels ocean-only run (without seaice)
   using the same wind forcing (uVel_3c0.bin, vVel_3c0.bin) (matlab script:
  "input/getdata.m")

  Two matlab scripts ("input/grph_res.m" and "input/grph_diag.m")
   are provided to make some basic plots (snap-shot and time-averaged
   diagnostics).

2) other (secondary) experiments (using the same executable)

 a) seaice-dynamics only with LSR solver (input.dyn_lsr/)
  use same forcing as main forward experiment,
  ( link input files from "input.dyn_lsr/" dir 1rst, then from "input/" dir )
  but does not use at all pkg/thsice (advect pkg/seaice properties using
   pkg/seaice advection S/R.); turn off seaice thermodynamics
  (usePW79thermodynamics=.FALSE., in input.dyn_lsr/data.seaice).

 b) seaice-dynamics only with JNFK solver (input.dyn_jfnk/)
  use same forcing as main forward experiment,
  ( link input files from "input.dyn_jfnk/" dir 1rst, then from "input/" dir )
  turn off seaice thermodynamics (thSIce_skipThermo=.TRUE., in file
   "input.dyn_jfnk/data.ice") and advect pkg/thsice properties using
   pkg/thsice advection S/R.

 c) seaice-thermodynamics only from pkg/seaice (input.thermo/)
  use same forcing as main forward experiment,
  ( link input files from "input.thermo/" dir 1rst, then from "input/" dir )
  Except a different bathymetry (no triangular shape coast line in the South,
   just a simple channel of constant width, with constant and uniform
   zonal current of 0.2 m/s):
   in "input.thermo/data":
    bathyFile = 'channel.bin',
    uVelInitFile    = 'const+20.bin',
    vVelInitFile    = 'const_00.bin',
  And use different initial seaice concentration from the main forward experiment:
   (in "input.thermo/data.seaice", AreaFile = 'ice0_area.bin',
                               and HeffFile = 'ice0_heff.bin',)
   100 % everywhere except in the 1rst and last 2 rows: 0., 10.% in the South
   and 1.%, 0. in the North:
  Turn off seaice dynamics (SEAICEuseDYNAMICS =.FALSE., in
   "input.thermo/data.seaice") which implies no advection (zero ice velocity).

 d) seaice-thermodynamics only from pkg/thsice (input.thsice/)
  use same forcing as main forward experiment,
  ( link input files from "input.thsice/" dir 1rst, then from "input/" dir )
  Except for bathymetry and initial seaice concentration which are identical
   to the one used in input.thermo/ :
   (thSIceFract_InitFile='ice0_area.bin', in "input.thsice/data.ice")
  No seaice dynamics and no seaice advection, so that none of pkg/seaice S/R
   are used (useSEAICE = .TRUE., commented out in "input.thsice/data.pkg"),

3) main adjoint experiment (code_ad, input_ad)
  Use similar forward set-up as "input.thermo/".
   (to be completed ...)
