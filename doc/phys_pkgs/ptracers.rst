.. _sub_phys_pkg_ptracers:

PTRACERS Package
----------------


Introduction
++++++++++++

This is a ''passive'' tracer package. Passive here means that the tracers
donâ€™t affect the density of the water (as opposed to temperature and
salinity) so no not actively affect the physics of the ocean. Tracers
are initialized, advected, diffused and various outputs are taken care
of in this package. For methods to add additional sources and sinks of
tracers use the :ref:`gchem Package <sub_phys_pkg_gchem>`.

Can use up tp 3843 tracers. But can not use the :ref:`diagnostics package <sub_outp_pkg_diagnostics>` with more
than about 90 tracers. Use :filelink:`utils/matlab/ioLb2num.m` and :filelink:`num2ioLb.m <utils/matlab/num2ioLB.m>` to
find correspondence between tracer number and tracer designation in the
code for more than 99 tracers (since tracers only have two digit
designations).

Key subroutines and parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The only code you should have to modify is: :filelink:`PTRACERS_SIZE.h <pkg/ptracers/PTRACERS_SIZE.h>` where
you need to set in the number of tracers to be used in the experiment:
:varlink:`PTRACERS_num`.

Run time parameters set in :code:`data.ptracers`:

- :varlink:`PTRACERS_Iter0` which is the integer timestep when the tracer experiment is initialized. If ``nIter0`` = ``PTRACERS_Iter0`` then the tracers are initialized to zero or from initial files. If ``nIter0`` :math:`>` ``PTRACERS_Iter0`` then tracers (and previous timestep tendency terms) are read in from a the ptracers pickup file. Note that tracers of zeros will be carried around if ``nIter0`` :math:`<` ``PTRACERS_Iter0``.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_numInUse`: number of tracers to be used in the run (needs to be :math:`<=` ``PTRACERS_num`` set in :filelink:`PTRACERS_SIZE.h <pkg/ptracers/PTRACERS_SIZE.h>`)
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_dumpFreq`: defaults to :varlink:`dumpFreq` (set in data)
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_taveFreq`: defaults to :varlink:`taveFreq` (set in data)
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_monitorFreq`: defaults to :varlink:`monitorFreq` (set in data)
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_timeave_mnc`: needs :varlink:`useMNC`, :varlink:`timeave_mnc`, default to false
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_snapshot_mnc`: needs :varlink:`useMNC` , :varlink:`snapshot_mnc`, default to false
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_monitor_mnc`: needs :varlink:`useMNC`, :varlink:`monitor_mnc`, default to false
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_pickup_write_mnc`: needs :varlink:`useMNC`, :varlink:`pickup_write_mnc`, default to false
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_pickup_read_mnc`: needs :varlink:`useMNC`, :varlink:`pickup_read_mnc`, default to false
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_useRecords`: defaults to false. If true, will write all tracers in a single file, otherwise each tracer in a seperate file.

The following can be set for each tracer (tracer number iTrc):

- :varlink:`PTRACERS_advScheme` (iTrc) will default to :varlink:`saltAdvScheme` (set in data). For other options see Table :ref:`adv_scheme_summary`.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_ImplVertAdv` (iTrc): implicit vertical advection flag, defaults to false.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_diffKh` (iTrc): horizontal Laplacian Diffusivity, defaults to :varlink:`diffKhS` (set in data).
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_diffK4` (iTrc): Biharmonic Diffusivity, defaults to :varlink:`diffK4S` (set in data).
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_diffKr` (iTrc): vertical diffusion, defaults to un-set.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_diffKrNr` (k,iTrc): level specific vertical diffusion, defaults to :varlink:`diffKrNrS`. Will be set to :varlink:`PTRACERS_diffKr` if this is set.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_ref` (k,iTrc): reference tracer value for each level k, defaults to 0. Currently only used for dilution/concentration of tracers at surface if :varlink:`PTRACERS_EvPrRn` (iTrc) is set and :varlink:`convertFW2Salt` (set in data) is set to something other than -1 (note default is :varlink:`convertFW2Salt` = 35).
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_EvPrRn` (iTrc): tracer concentration in freshwater. Needed for calculation of dilution/concentration in surface layer due to freshwater addition/evaporation. Defaults to un-set in which case no dilution/concentration occurs.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_useGMRedi` (iTrc): apply GM or not. Defaults to :varlink:`useGMREdi`.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_useKPP` (iTrc): apply KPP or not. Defaults to :varlink:`useKPP`.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_initialFile` (iTrc): file with initial tracer concentration. Will be used if ``PTRACERS_Iter0`` :math:`=` ``nIter0``. Default is no name, in which case tracer is initialised as zero. If ``PTRACERS_Iter0`` :math:`<` ``nIter0``, then tracer concentration will come from ``pickup_ptracer``.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_names` (iTrc): tracer name. Needed for netcdf. Defaults to nothing.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_long_names` (iTrc): optional name in long form of tracer.
- :varlink:`PTRACERS_units` (iTrc): optional units of tracer.

Note that these will only work for 90 or less tracers (some problems
with the numbering/designation over this number)
