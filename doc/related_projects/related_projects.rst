Projects Related to MITgcm
==========================

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)
----------------------------------------------------------

ECCO is an oceanic reanalysis product that makes use of MITgcm's adjoint capabilities to assimilate observations into a dynamically self-consistent state estimate.

Octopus - Lagrangian Particle Tracker
---------------------------------------

Octopus is an offline Lagrangian particle tracker that uses saved velocity fields from MITgcm simulations.

OceanParcels - Lagrangian Particle Tracker
------------------------------------------

Parcels provides a set of Python classses and methods to create customizable particle tracking simulations, focussing on tracking of both passive water parcels as well as active plankton, plastic and fish.

Southern Ocean State Estimation (SOSE)
--------------------------------------

SOSE uses the same techniques as ECCO to produce an eddy-permitting state estimate of the Southern Ocean.

Xgcm: General Circulation Model Postprocessing with xarray
----------------------------------------------------------

Xgcm is a python packge for working with the datasets produced by numerical General Circulation Models
(GCMs) and similar gridded datasets that are amenable to finite volume analysis. In these datasets, different
variables are located at different positions with respect to a volume or area element (e.g. cell center, cell face,
etc.) xgcm solves the problem of how to interpolate and difference these variables from one position to another.

Xmitgcm
-------

Xmitgcm is a Python module that loads MITgcm MDS output files as `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ datasets with the associated grid information. These can be easily exported as NetCDF files.
