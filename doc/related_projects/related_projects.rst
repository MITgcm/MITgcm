Projects Related to MITgcm
==========================

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)
----------------------------------------------------------

ECCO is an oceanic reanalysis product that makes use of MITgcm's adjoint capabilities to assimilate observations into a dynamically self-consistent state estimate.

Octopus - Lagrangian Particle Tracker
---------------------------------------

Octopus is an offline Lagrangian particle tracker that uses saved velocity fields from MITgcm simulations.

Southern Ocean State Estimation (SOSE)
--------------------------------------

SOSE uses the same techniques as ECCO to produce an eddy-permitting state estimate of the Southern Ocean.

xmitgcm
-------

xmitgcm is a Python module that loads MITgcm MDS output files as `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ arrays with the associated grid information. These can be easily exported as NetCDF files.
