Global ocean circulation
------------------------

:numref:`large-scale-circ` shows the pattern of ocean
currents at the surface of a 4° global ocean model run with
15 vertical levels. Lopped cells are used to represent topography on a
regular *lat-lon* grid extending from 70°N to
70°S. The model is driven using monthly-mean winds with
mixed boundary conditions on temperature and salinity at the surface.
The transfer properties of ocean eddies, convection and mixing is
parameterized in this model.

    Pattern of surface ocean currents from a global integration of the model at 4° horizontal resolution and with 15 vertical levels.

:numref:`large-scale-circ2` shows the meridional overturning
circulation of the global ocean in Sverdrups.
