Ocean biogeochemical cycles
---------------------------


MITgcm is being used to study global biogeochemical cycles in the
ocean. For example one can study the effects of interannual changes in
meteorological forcing and upper ocean circulation on the fluxes of
carbon dioxide and oxygen between the ocean and atmosphere. :numref:`biogeo_figure`
shows the annual air-sea flux of oxygen and its
relation to density outcrops in the southern oceans from a single year
of a global, interannually varying simulation. The simulation is run
at 1째x1째 resolution telescoping to :math:`\frac{1}{3}^{\circ}` x :math:`\frac{1}{3}^{\circ}` in the tropics (not shown).

    Annual air-sea flux of oxygen (shaded) plotted along with potential density outcrops of the surface of the southern ocean from a global 1째x1째 integration with a telescoping grid (to :math:`\frac{1}{3}^{\circ}` ) at the equator.
