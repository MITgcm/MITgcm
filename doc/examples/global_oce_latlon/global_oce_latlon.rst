Global Ocean Simulation
=======================

  (in directory: :filelink:`verification/tutorial_global_oce_latlon/`)

This example experiment demonstrates using the MITgcm to simulate the
planetary ocean circulation. The simulation is configured with
realistic geography and bathymetry on a
:math:`4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}` spherical polar grid. Fifteen levels are used in the
vertical, ranging in thickness from 50 m at the surface to 690 m at depth, giving a
maximum model depth of 5200 m. Different time-steps are
used to accelerate the convergence to equilibrium (see Bryan 1984 :cite:`bryan:84`)
so that, at this resolution, the
configuration can be integrated forward for thousands of years on a
single processor desktop computer.

Overview
--------

The model is forced with climatological wind stress data from Trenberth (1990)
:cite:`trenberth:90` and NCEP surface flux data from Kalnay et al. (1996)
:cite:`kalnay:96`. Climatological data (Levitus and Boyer 1994a,b :cite:`levitus:94a,levitus:94b`)
is used to initialize the model
hydrography. Levitus and Boyer seasonal climatology
data is also used throughout the calculation to provide additional
air-sea fluxes. These fluxes are combined with the NCEP climatological
estimates of surface heat flux, resulting in a mixed boundary condition
of the style described in Haney (1971) :cite:`haney:71`. Altogether, this
yields the following forcing applied in the model surface layer.

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{u} = \frac{\tau_{x}}{\rho_{0} \Delta z_{s}}
   :label: eg-global_forcing-Fu

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{v} = \frac{\tau_{y}}{\rho_{0} \Delta z_{s}}
   :label: eg-global_forcing-Fv

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{\theta} = - \lambda_{\theta} ( \theta - \theta^{\ast} )
    - \frac{1}{C_{p} \rho_{0} \Delta z_{s}}{\cal Q}
   :label: eg-global_forcing-Ftheta

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{s} = - \lambda_{s} ( S - S^{\ast} )
    + \frac{S_{0}}{\Delta z_{s}}({\cal E} - {\cal P} - {\cal R})
   :label: eg-global_forcing-Fs

where :math:`{\cal F}_{u}`, :math:`{\cal F}_{v}`,
:math:`{\cal F}_{\theta}`, :math:`{\cal F}_{s}` are the forcing terms in
the zonal and meridional momentum and in the potential temperature and
salinity equations respectively. The term :math:`\Delta z_{s}`
represents the top ocean layer thickness in meters. It is used in
conjunction with a reference density, :math:`\rho_{0}` (here set to
999.8 kg m\ :sup:`-3`), a reference salinity, :math:`S_{0}`
(here set to 35 ppt), and a specific heat capacity, :math:`C_{p}` (here
set to 4000 J kg\ :sup:`-1` K\ :sup:`-1`), to
convert input dataset values into time tendencies of potential
temperature (with units of :sup:`o`\ C s\ :sup:`-1`),
salinity (with units ppt s\ :sup:`-1`) and velocity (with units
m s\ :sup:`-2`). The externally supplied forcing fields
used in this experiment are :math:`\tau_{x}`, :math:`\tau_{y}`,
:math:`\theta^{\ast}`, :math:`S^{\ast}`, :math:`\cal{Q}` and
:math:`\mathcal{E}-\mathcal{P}-\mathcal{R}`. The wind stress fields (:math:`\tau_x`,
:math:`\tau_y`) have units of N m\ :sup:`-2`. The
temperature forcing fields (:math:`\theta^{\ast}` and :math:`Q`) have
units of :sup:`o`\ C and W m\ :sup:`-2`
respectively. The salinity forcing fields (:math:`S^{\ast}` and
:math:`\cal{E}-\cal{P}-\cal{R}`) have units of ppt and
m s\ :sup:`-1` respectively. The source files and
procedures for ingesting this data into the simulation are described in
the experiment configuration discussion in section
:numref:`sec_eg-global-clim_ocn_examp_exp_config`.

Discrete Numerical Configuration
--------------------------------

The model is configured in hydrostatic form. The domain is discretized
with a uniform grid spacing in latitude and longitude on the sphere
:math:`\Delta \phi=\Delta \lambda=4^{\circ}`, so that there are 90
grid cells in the zonal and 40 in the meridional direction. The
internal model coordinate variables :math:`x` and :math:`y` are
initialized according to

.. math::

   x &= r\cos(\phi), &\Delta x & = r\cos(\Delta \phi)

   y &= r\lambda, &\Delta y &= r\Delta \lambda

Arctic polar regions are not included in this experiment. Meridionally
the model extends from 80\ :sup:`o`\ S to
80\ :sup:`o`\ N. Vertically the model is configured with
fifteen layers with the following thicknesses:

  |    :math:`\Delta z_{1}` = 50 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{2}` = 70 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{3}` = 100 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{4}` = 140 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{5}` = 190 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{6}` = 240 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{7}` = 290 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{8}` = 340 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{9}` = 390 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{10}` = 440 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{11}` = 490 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{12}` = 540 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{13}` = 590 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{14}` = 640 m
  |    :math:`\Delta z_{15}` = 690 m

(here the numeric subscript indicates the model level index number,
:math:`{\tt k}`) to give a total depth, :math:`H`, of
-5200 m. The implicit free surface form of the pressure
equation described in Marshall et al. (1997) :cite:`marshall:97a` is employed. A
Laplacian operator, :math:`\nabla^2`, provides viscous dissipation.
Thermal and haline diffusion is also represented by a Laplacian
operator.

Wind-stress forcing is added to the momentum equations in
:eq:`eg-global-model_equations_uv` for both the zonal
flow :math:`u` and the meridional flow :math:`v`, according to
equations :eq:`eg-global_forcing-Fu` and :eq:`eg-global_forcing-Fv`. Thermodynamic
forcing inputs are added to the equations in
:eq:`eg-global-model_equations_ts` for potential
temperature, :math:`\theta`, and salinity, :math:`S`, according to equations
:eq:`eg-global_forcing-Ftheta` and :eq:`eg-global_forcing-Fs`.  This produces a set
of equations solved in this configuration as follows:

.. math::
   :label: eg-global-model_equations_uv

   \frac{Du}{Dt} - fv +
     \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p'}{\partial x} -
     \nabla_{h}\cdot A_{h}\nabla_{h}u -
     \frac{\partial}{\partial z}A_{z}\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
     \mathcal{F}_u & \text{(surface)} \\
     0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}
   \\
   \frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu +
     \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p'}{\partial y} -
     \nabla_{h}\cdot A_{h}\nabla_{h}v -
     \frac{\partial}{\partial z}A_{z}\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
     \mathcal{F}_v & \text{(surface)} \\
     0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}

.. math::
      \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \nabla_{h}\cdot \vec{u} = 0

.. math::
   :label: eg-global-model_equations_ts

   \frac{D\theta}{Dt} -
    \nabla_{h}\cdot K_{h}\nabla_{h}\theta
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Gamma(K_{z})\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial z}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_\theta & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}
   \\
   \frac{D s}{Dt} -
    \nabla_{h}\cdot K_{h}\nabla_{h}s
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Gamma(K_{z})\frac{\partial s}{\partial z}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_s & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}
   \\

.. math::
   g\rho_{0} \eta + \int^{0}_{-z}\rho' dz = p'

where :math:`u=\frac{Dx}{Dt}=r \cos(\phi)\frac{D \lambda}{Dt}` and
:math:`v=\frac{Dy}{Dt}=r \frac{D \phi}{Dt}` are the zonal and
meridional components of the flow vector, :math:`\vec{u}`, on the
sphere. As described in :numref:`discret_algorithm`, the time evolution of
potential temperature :math:`\theta` equation is solved
prognostically. The total pressure :math:`p` is diagnosed by summing
pressure due to surface elevation :math:`\eta` and the hydrostatic
pressure.

Numerical Stability Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Laplacian dissipation coefficient, :math:`A_{h}`, is set to
:math:`5 \times 10^5` m s\ :sup:`-1`. This value is chosen to yield a Munk
layer width (see Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`),

.. math::
   M_{w} = \pi ( \frac { A_{h} }{ \beta } )^{\frac{1}{3}}
   :label: eq:eg-global-munk_layer

of ~600 km. This is greater than
the model resolution in low-latitudes,
:math:`\Delta x \approx` 400 km, ensuring that the frictional
boundary layer is adequately resolved.

The model is stepped forward with a time step
:math:`\Delta
t_{\theta}` = 24 hours for thermodynamic variables and
:math:`\Delta t_{v}` = 30 minutes for momentum terms. With this time step, the
stability parameter to the horizontal Laplacian friction
(Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`)

.. math::
   S_{l} = 4 \frac{A_{h} \Delta t_{v}}{{\Delta x}^2}
   :label: eq:eg-global-laplacian_stability

evaluates to 0.6 at a latitude of
:math:`\phi` = 80\ :sup:`o`, which is above the 0.3 upper limit for
stability, but the zonal grid spacing :math:`\Delta x` is smallest at
:math:`\phi` = 80\ :sup:`o` where :math:`\Delta
x=r\cos(\phi)\Delta \phi\approx` 77 km and the stability criterion
is already met one grid cell equatorwards (at :math:`\phi` = 76\ :sup:`o`).

The vertical dissipation coefficient,
:math:`A_{z}`, is set to :math:`1\times10^{-3}` m\ :sup:`2` s\ :sup:`-1`.
The associated stability limit

.. math::
   S_{l} = 4 \frac{A_{z} \Delta t_{v}}{{\Delta z}^2}
   :label: eg-global-laplacian_stability_z

evaluates to 0.0029 for the smallest
model level spacing (:math:`\Delta z_{1}` = 50 m) which is well
below the upper stability limit.

The numerical stability for inertial
oscillations (Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`)

.. math::
   S_{i} = f^{2} {\Delta t_v}^2
   :label: eg-global-inertial_stability

evaluates to 0.07 for
:math:`f=2\omega\sin(80^{\circ})=1.43\times10^{-4}` s\ :sup:`-1`,
which is below the :math:`S_{i} < 1` upper limit for stability.

The advective CFL (Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`)
for a extreme maximum horizontal flow
speed of :math:`| \vec{u} |` = 2 m s\ :sup:`-1`

.. math::
   S_{a} = \frac{| \vec{u} | \Delta t_{v}}{ \Delta x}
   :label: eg-global-cfl_stability

evaluates to :math:`5 \times 10^{-2}`. This is
well below the stability limit of 0.5.

The stability parameter for internal gravity
waves propagating with a maximum speed of
:math:`c_{g}` = 10 m s\ :sup:`-1` (Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`)

.. math::
   S_{c} = \frac{c_{g} \Delta t_{v}}{ \Delta x}
   :label: eg-global-gfl_stability

evaluates to :math:`2.3 \times 10^{-1}`. This is
close to the linear stability limit of 0.5.
