Global Ocean Simulation in Pressure Coordinates
===============================================

  (in directory: :filelink:`verification/tutorial_global_oce_in_p/`)

This example experiment demonstrates using MITgcm to simulate the
planetary ocean circulation in pressure coordinates, that is, without
making the Boussinesq approximations. The simulation is configured as a near
copy of tutorial_global_oce_latlon
(:numref:`sec_global_oce_latlon`). with realistic geography and
bathymetry on a :math:`4^{\circ} \times
4^{\circ}` spherical polar grid. Fifteen levels are used in the
vertical, ranging in thickness from
50.4089 dbar :math:`\approx` 50 m at the surface to
710.33 dbar :math:`\approx` 690 m at depth, giving a
maximum model depth of
5302.3122 dbar :math:`\approx` 5200 m. At this
resolution, the configuration can be integrated forward for thousands of
years on a single processor desktop computer.

Overview
--------

The model is forced with climatological wind stress data from
Trenberth (1990) :cite:`trenberth:90` and surface flux data from Jiang et al. (1999)
:cite:`jiang:99`. Climatological data (Levitus and Boyer 1994a,b :cite:`levitus:94a,levitus:94b`)
is used to initialize the model
hydrography. Levitus and Boyer seasonal climatology
data is also used throughout the calculation to provide additional
air-sea fluxes. These fluxes are combined with the Jiang et al. climatological
estimates of surface heat flux, resulting in a mixed boundary condition
of the style described in Haney (1971) :cite:`haney:71`. Altogether, this
yields the following forcing applied in the model surface layer.

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{u} = g\frac{\tau_{x}}{\Delta p_{s}}
  :label: eg-global_forcing_fu_pcoord

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{v} = g\frac{\tau_{y}}{\Delta p_{s}}
   :label: eg-global_forcing_fv_pcoord

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{\theta} = - g\lambda_{\theta} ( \theta - \theta^{\ast} )
    - \frac{1}{C_{p} \Delta p_{s}}{\cal Q}
   :label: eg-global_forcing_ft_pcoord

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{s} =
    + g\rho_{FW}\frac{S}{\rho\Delta p_{s}}({\cal E} - {\cal P} - {\cal R})
   :label: eg-global_forcing_fs_pcoord

where :math:`{\cal F}_{u}`, :math:`{\cal F}_{v}`,
:math:`{\cal F}_{\theta}`, :math:`{\cal F}_{s}` are the forcing terms in
the zonal and meridional momentum and in the potential temperature and
salinity equations respectively. The term :math:`\Delta p_{s}`
represents the top ocean layer thickness in Pa. It is used in
conjunction with a reference density, :math:`\rho_{FW}` (here set to
999.8 kg m\ :sup:`-3`), the surface salinity, :math:`S`, and a
specific heat capacity, :math:`C_{p}` (here set to
4000 J kg\ :sup:`-1` K\ :sup:`-1`), to convert
input dataset values into time tendencies of potential temperature (with
units of :sup:`o`\ C s\ :sup:`-1`), salinity (with units
ppt s\ :sup:`-1`) and velocity (with units m s\ :sup:`-2`).
The externally supplied forcing fields used in this experiment are
:math:`\tau_{x}`, :math:`\tau_{y}`, :math:`\theta^{\ast}`,
:math:`\cal{Q}` and :math:`\cal{E}-\cal{P}-\cal{R}`. The wind stress
fields (:math:`\tau_x`, :math:`\tau_y`) have units of
N m\ :sup:`-2`. The temperature forcing fields
(:math:`\theta^{\ast}` and :math:`Q`) have units of
:sup:`o`\ C and W m\ :sup:`-2` respectively.
The salinity forcing fields (:math:`\cal{E}-\cal{P}-\cal{R}`) has units of
m s\ :sup:`-1` respectively. The source files and
procedures for ingesting these data into the simulation are described in
the experiment configuration discussion in section
:numref:`sec_eg-global-clim_ocn_examp_exp_config`.

Discrete Numerical Configuration
--------------------------------

Due to the pressure coordinate, the model can only be hydrostatic (de Szoeke and Samelson 2002
:cite:`deszoeke:02`). The domain is discretized with a uniform
grid spacing in latitude and longitude on the sphere
:math:`\Delta \phi=\Delta
\lambda=4^{\circ}`, so that there are 90 grid cells in the zonal and
40 in the meridional direction. The internal model coordinate
variables :math:`x` and :math:`y` are initialized according to

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   x=r\cos(\phi),~\Delta x & = &r\cos(\Delta \phi) \\
   y=r\lambda,~\Delta y &= &r\Delta \lambda \end{aligned}

Arctic polar regions are not included in this experiment. Meridionally
the model extends from 80\ :sup:`o`\ S to
80\ :sup:`o`\ N. Vertically the model is configured with
fifteen layers with the following thicknesses

  |    :math:`\Delta p_{1}` = 7103300.720021 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{2}` = 6570548.440790 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{3}` = 6041670.010249 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{4}` = 5516436.666057 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{5}` = 4994602.034410 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{6}` = 4475903.435290 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{7}` = 3960063.245801 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{8}` = 3446790.312651 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{9}` = 2935781.405664 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{10}` = 2426722.705046 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{11}` = 1919291.315988 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{12}` = 1413156.804970 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{13}` = 1008846.750166 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{14}` = 705919.025481 Pa
  |    :math:`\Delta p_{15}` = 504089.693499 Pa

(here the numeric subscript indicates the model level index number,
:math:`{\tt k}`; note that the surface layer has the highest index
number 15) to give a total depth, :math:`H`, of -5200 m. In
pressure, this is :math:`p_{b}^{0}` = 53023122.566084 Pa. The
implicit free surface form of the pressure equation described in
Marshall et al. (1997) :cite:`marshall:97a` with the nonlinear extension by Campin et al. (2004)
:cite:`cam:04` is employed. A Laplacian operator,
:math:`\nabla^2`, provides viscous dissipation. Thermal and haline
diffusion is also represented by a Laplacian operator.

Wind-stress forcing is added to the momentum equations in
:eq:`eg-global-model_equations_pcoord_uv` for both the
zonal flow, :math:`u` and the meridional flow :math:`v`, according to
equations :eq:`eg-global_forcing_fu_pcoord` and :eq:`eg-global_forcing_fv_pcoord`. Thermodynamic
forcing inputs are added to the equations in
:eq:`eg-global-model_equations_pcoord_ts` for potential
temperature, :math:`\theta`, and salinity, :math:`S`, according to
equations :eq:`eg-global_forcing_ft_pcoord` and :eq:`eg-global_forcing_fs_pcoord`. This produces a set
of equations solved in this configuration as follows:

.. math::
   :label: eg-global-model_equations_pcoord_uv

   \frac{Du}{Dt} - fv +
     \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \Phi^{'}}{\partial x} -
     \nabla_{h}\cdot A_{h}\nabla_{h}u -
     (g\rho_0)^2\frac{\partial}{\partial p}A_{r}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}
    &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_u & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}
   \\
   \frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu +
     \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \Phi^{'}}{\partial y} -
     \nabla_{h}\cdot A_{h}\nabla_{h}v -
     (g\rho_0)^2\frac{\partial}{\partial p}A_{r}\frac{\partial v}{\partial p}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_v & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}

.. math::
  \frac{\partial p_{b}}{\partial t} + \nabla_{h}\cdot \vec{u} = 0

.. math::
   :label: eg-global-model_equations_pcoord_ts

   \frac{D\theta}{Dt} -
    \nabla_{h}\cdot K_{h}\nabla_{h}\theta
    - (g\rho_0)^2\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\Gamma(K_{r})\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial p}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_\theta & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}
   \\
   \frac{D s}{Dt} -
    \nabla_{h}\cdot K_{h}\nabla_{h}s
    - (g\rho_0)^2\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\Gamma(K_{r})\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}
   &=
   \begin{cases}
   {\cal F}_s & \text{(surface)} \\
   0 & \text{(interior)}
   \end{cases}

.. math::
   \Phi_{-H}'^{(0)} + \alpha_{0}p_{b}+ \int^{p}_{0}\alpha' dp = \Phi'

where :math:`u=\frac{Dx}{Dt}=r \cos(\phi)\frac{D \lambda}{Dt}` and
:math:`v=\frac{Dy}{Dt}=r \frac{D \phi}{Dt}` are the zonal and meridional
components of the flow vector, :math:`\vec{u}`, on the sphere. As
described in :numref:`discret_algorithm`, the time evolution of potential
temperature :math:`\theta` equation is solved prognostically. The full
geopotential height :math:`\Phi` is diagnosed by summing the
geopotential height anomalies :math:`\Phi'` due to bottom pressure
:math:`p_{b}` and density variations. The integration of the hydrostatic
equation is started at the bottom of the domain. The condition of
:math:`p=0` at the sea surface requires a time-independent integration
constant for the height anomaly due to density variations
:math:`\Phi_{-H}'^{(0)}`, which is provided as an input field.

The units and orientation of the depths in this file are the same as
used in the MITgcm code (Pa for this experiment). In this experiment, a
depth of 0 Pa indicates a land point (wall) and a depth of
>0 Pa indicates open ocean.

File ``input/deltageopotjmd95.box``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains twelve identical 2-D maps (:math:`x,y`) of
geopotential height anomaly at the bottom at rest. The values have been
obtained by vertically integrating the hydrostatic equation with the
initial density field (using ``input/lev_t.bin`` and ``input/lev_s.bin``). This file has to be
consistent with the temperature and salinity field at rest and the choice
of equation of state!

Files ``input/lev_t.bin`` and ``input/lev_s.bin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files ``input/lev_t.bin`` and ``input/lev_s.bin`` specify the initial conditions for
temperature and salinity for every grid point in a 3-D
array (:math:`x,y,z`). The data are obtain by interpolating monthly mean
values using Levitus and Boyer (1994a,b) :cite:`levitus:94a,levitus:94b` for January onto the model grid.
Keep in mind that the first index corresponds to the bottom layer and
highest index to the surface layer.

Files ``input/trenberth_taux.bin`` and ``input/trenberth_tauy.bin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files ``input/trenberth_taux.bin`` and  ``input/trenberth_tauy.bin`` contain twelve
2-D (:math:`x,y`) maps of zonal and meridional wind stress
values, :math:`\tau_{x}` and :math:`\tau_{y}`, respectively, in 3-D arrays (:math:`x,y,t`).
These are monthly mean
values from Trenberth et al. (1990) :cite:`trenberth:90`, units of N m\ :sup:`-2`.

File ``input/lev_sst.bin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file ``input/lev_sst.bin`` contains twelve monthly surface temperature
climatologies from Levitus and Boyer (1994b) :cite:`levitus:94b` in a 3-D
arrays (:math:`x,y,t`).

Files ``input/shi_qnet.bin`` and ``input/shi_empmr.bin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files ``input/shi_qnet.bin`` and ``input/shi_empmr.bin`` contain twelve monthly surface fluxes
of heat (qnet) and freshwater (empmr) from Jiang et al. (1999) :cite:`jiang:99` in
3-D arrays (:math:`x,y,t`). Both fluxes are normalized so
that the total forcing over one year results in no net flux into the ocean (note, the freshwater
flux is actually constant in time).

File :filelink:`code/SIZE.h <verification/tutorial_global_oce_in_p/code/SIZE.h>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file :filelink:`code/SIZE.h <verification/tutorial_global_oce_in_p/code/SIZE.h>` is identical to that
described in :ref:`tutorial global ocean simulation <sec_global_oce_latlon>`, for more specifics see :numref:`tut_global_oce_latlon_code_size`.

File :filelink:`code/CPP_OPTIONS.h <verification/tutorial_global_oce_in_p/code/CPP_OPTIONS.h>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file uses standard default values except for:

-  ``#define`` :varlink:`ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING`

   enables pressure loading which is abused to include the initial
   geopotential height anomaly.

-  ``#define`` :varlink:`EXACT_CONSERV`

   enables more accurate conservation properties to include the
   horizontal mass divergence in the free surface.

-  ``#define`` :varlink:`NONLIN_FRSURF`

   enables the nonlinear free surface.
