MITgcm Tutorial Example Experiments
***********************************

The full MITgcm distribution comes with a set of pre-configured
numerical experiments.  Some of these example experiments are tests of
individual parts of the model code, but many are fully fledged
numerical simulations. Full tutorials exist for a few of the examples,
and are documented in sections :numref:`sec_eg_baro` -
:numref:`sec_eg_tank`. The other examples follow the same general
structure as the tutorial examples. However, they only include brief
instructions in text file README.  The examples are
located in subdirectories under the directory :filelink:`verification`.
Each example is briefly described below.
