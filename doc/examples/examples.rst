MITgcm Tutorial Example Experiments
***********************************

The full MITgcm distribution comes with a set of pre-configured
numerical experiments.  Some of these example experiments are tests of
individual parts of the model code, but many are fully fledged
numerical simulations. Full tutorials exist for a few of the examples,
and are documented in sections :numref:`sec_eg_baro` -
:numref:`sec_eg_tank`. The other examples follow the same general
structure as the tutorial examples, see below.  All example experiments are
located in subdirectories under the directory :filelink:`verification`.
A list of additional experiments (i.e, not documented as full tutorials), with brief description,
is provided in :numref:`subsec_add_expts_fwd` and :numref:`subsec_add_expts_adj`.

Each example experiment directory has the following subdirectories:

-  ``code``: contains code specific to the example. At a minimum,
   this directory includes the following files:

   -  ``code/packages.conf``: declares the list of packages or package
      groups to be used. If not included, the default set of packages is located
      in :filelink:`pkg/pkg_groups`. Package groups are simply convenient
      collections of commonly used packages which are defined in
      :filelink:`pkg/pkg_groups` (see :ref:`using_packages`).
      Some packages may require other packages or
      may require their absence (that is, they are incompatible) and
      these package dependencies are listed in :filelink:`pkg/pkg_depend`.

   -  ``code/SIZE.h``: declares the size of underlying computational grid.
      This file is compiled instead of the MITgcm repository version :filelink:`model/inc/SIZE.h`.

   -  The ``code/`` directory may include other files and subroutines specific to the experiment,
      i.e., containing changes from the standard repository version.
      For example, some experiments contains CPP header options files to enable or disable
      some parts of the code at compile time; the most common ones would be :filelink:`model/inc/CPP_OPTIONS.h`
      for core model options  and «PKG»_OPTIONS.h for individual packages.

-  ``input``: contains the input data files required to run the example.
   At a minimum, the ``input`` directory contains the following files:

   -  ``input/data``: this file, written as a namelist, specifies the
      main parameters for the experiment.

   -  ``input/data.pkg``: contains parameters relative to the packages
      used in the experiment.

   -  ``input/eedata``: this file contains “execution environment” data.
      This consists of a specification of the number of
      threads to use in :math:`x` and :math:`y`. For multi-threaded execution,these will be set to numbers greater than 1.

   - Forcing and topography file(s), as well as files describing the initial state of
     the experiment and any other supporting data.
     Required support files vary from experiment to experiment, depending on the setup.

-  ``results``: this directory contains the output file ``output.txt``
   produced by the simulation example. This file is useful for
   comparison with your own output when you run the experiment.

-  ``build``: this directory is initially empty and should be used to compile
   the model and generate the executable.

-  ``run``: this directory is initially empty and should be used to run the
   executable. From the (empty) run directory, link files from ``input``
   using the command ``ln -s ../input/* .``, then execute the file ``../input/prepare_run`` if it exists.
   If you are running one of the experiment variations, i.e., using ``input.«OTHER»``,
   first link files from ``input.«OTHER»`` (running ``../input.«OTHER»/prepare_run`` if it exists) and next link files from ``input``
   (and run ``../input/prepare_run``). Following this procedure, file links
   from ``input.«OTHER»`` will NOT be overwritten by identically named files in ``input``.
