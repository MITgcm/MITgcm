Held-Suarez Atmosphere
======================

(in directory: :filelink:`verification/tutorial_held_suarez_cs/`)

This example illustrates the use of the MITgcm as an atmospheric GCM,
using simple Held and Suarez (1994) :cite:`held-suar:94` forcing to simulate
atmospheric dynamics on global scale. The set-up uses the rescaled
pressure coordinate (:math:`p^*`) of Adcroft and Campin (2004) :cite:`adcroft:04a` in
the vertical direction, with 20 equally-spaced levels, and the conformal
cube-sphere grid (C32) described in Adcroft et al. (2004) :cite:`adcroft:04b`.

Overview
--------

This example demonstrates using the MITgcm to simulate the planetary
atmospheric circulation, with flat orography and simplified forcing. In
particular, only dry air processes are considered and radiation effects
are represented by a simple Newtonian cooling, Thus, this example does
not rely on any particular atmospheric physics package. This kind of
simplified atmospheric simulation has been widely used in GFD-type
experiments and in intercomparison projects of AGCM dynamical cores
(Held and Suarez 1994 :cite:`held-suar:94`).

The horizontal grid is obtain from the projection of a uniform gridded
cube to the sphere. Each of the 6 faces has the same resolution, with
32 :math:`\times` 32 grid points. The equator coincides with a grid
line and crosses through the middle in 4 of the 6 faces, leaving 2 faces
for the northern and southern polar regions. This curvilinear grid
requires the use of the 2\ :sup:`nd` generation exchange topology (:filelink:`pkg/exch2`)
to connect tile and face edges, but without any limitation on the number
of processors.

The use of the :math:`p^*` coordinate with 20 equally spaced levels
(20 :math:`\times` 50 mb, from :math:`p^*=1000` mb to
:math:`0` at the top of the atmosphere) follows the choice of
Held and Suarez (1994) :cite:`held-suar:94`. Note that without topography, the
:math:`p^*` coordinate and the normalized pressure coordinate
(:math:`\sigma_p`) coincide exactly. Both viscosity and diffusivity are
set to zero here, but an 8\ :sup:`th` order Shapiro (1970) :cite:`shapiro:70`
filter is applied to both momentum and potential temperature, to remove
selectively grid scale noise. Apart from the horizontal grid, this
experiment is made very similar to the grid-point model case used in
the Held and Suarez (1994) :cite:`held-suar:94` study.

At this resolution, the configuration can be integrated forward for
many years on a single processor desktop computer.

Forcing
-------

The model is forced by relaxation to a radiative equilibrium temperature
from Held and Suarez (1994) :cite:`held-suar:94`. A linear frictional drag
(Rayleigh damping) is applied in the lower part of the atmosphere and
accounts for surface friction and momentum dissipation in the boundary
layer. Altogether, this yields the following forcing from
Held and Suarez (1994) :cite:`held-suar:94` that is applied to the fluid:

.. math::
   \vec{{\cal F}_\mathbf{v}} = -k_\mathbf{v}(p)\vec{\mathbf{v}}_h
   :label: eg-hs-global_forcing_fv

.. math::
   {\cal F}_{\theta} = -k_{\theta}(\varphi,p)[\theta-\theta_{eq}(\varphi,p)]
  :label: eg-hs-global_forcing_ft

where :math:`\vec{\cal F}_\mathbf{v}`, :math:`{\cal F}_{\theta}`, are
the forcing terms in the zonal and meridional momentum and in the
potential temperature equations, respectively. The term
:math:`k_\mathbf{v}` in :eq:`eg-hs-global_forcing_fv`
applies a Rayleigh damping that is active within the planetary boundary
layer. It is defined so as to decay as pressure decreases according to

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eq:eg-hs-define_kv}
   k_\mathbf{v} & = & k_{f}~\max[0,~(p^*/P^{0}_{s}-\sigma_{b})/(1-\sigma_{b})]
   \\
   \sigma_{b} & = & 0.7 ~~{\rm and}~~
   k_{f}  =  1/86400 ~{\rm s}^{-1}\end{aligned}

where :math:`p^*` is the pressure level of the cell center and
:math:`P^{0}_{s}` is the pressure at the base of the atmospheric column,
which is constant and uniform here (:math:`= 10^5 {\rm Pa}`), in the
absence of topography.

The equilibrium temperature :math:`\theta_{eq}` and relaxation time
scale :math:`k_{\theta}` are set to:

.. math::
   \theta_{eq}(\varphi,p^*)  = \max \{ 200 (P^{0}_{s}/p^*)^\kappa,
   \nonumber \hspace{2mm} 315 - \Delta T_y~\sin^2(\varphi)
     - \Delta \theta_z \cos^2(\varphi) \log(p^*/P^{0}_s) \}
   :label: eg-hs-define_Teq

.. math::
   k_{\theta}(\varphi,p^*) =
   k_a + (k_s -k_a)~\cos^4(\varphi)~\max \{ 0,\nonumber \hspace{2mm} (p^*/P^{0}_{s}-\sigma_{b})/(1-\sigma_{b}) \}
   :label: eg-hs-define_kT

with:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
    \Delta T_y = 60 \text{ K, }  k_a &= 1/(40 \cdot 86400) ~{\rm s}^{-1}\\
   \Delta \theta_z = 10 \text{ K, }  k_s &= 1/(4 \cdot 86400) ~{\rm s}^{-1}\end{aligned}

Initial conditions correspond to a resting state with horizontally
uniform stratified fluid. The initial temperature profile is simply the
horizontal average of the radiative equilibrium temperature.

Set-up description
------------------

The model is configured in hydrostatic form, using non-Boussinesq
:math:`p^*` coordinate. The vertical resolution is uniform,
:math:`\Delta p^* = 50 \times 10^2` Pa, with 20 levels, from
:math:`p^*=10^5` Pa to :math:`0` at the top. The domain is discretized
using the C32 cube-sphere grid (see Adcroft et al. 2004 :cite:`adcroft:04b`) that covers
the whole sphere with a relatively uniform grid spacing. The resolution
at the equator or along the Greenwich meridian is similar to a
128 :math:`\times` 64 equally spaced longitude-latitude grid, but
requires 25% less grid points. Grid spacing and grid-point
location are not computed by the model, but instead read from files.

The vector-invariant form of the momentum equation (see :numref:`vec_invar_mom_eqs`)
is used so that no explicit metrics are necessary.

Applying the vector-invariant discretization to the atmospheric
equations :eq:`atmos-prime`, and adding the forcing terms
:eq:`eg-hs-global_forcing\_fv`, :eq:`eg-hs-global_forcing_ft` on the
right-hand-side, leads to the set of equations that are solved in this
configuration:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h}{\partial t}
   +(f + \zeta)\hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h
   +\mathbf{\nabla }_{p} (\rm{KE})
   + \omega \frac{\partial \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h }{\partial p}
   +\mathbf{\nabla }_p \Phi ^{\prime }
   = -k_\mathbf{v}\vec{\mathbf{v}}_h
   :label: eg-hs-model_equations

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \Phi ^{\prime }}{\partial p}
   +\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial p}\theta ^{\prime } =0

.. math::
   \mathbf{\nabla }_{p}\cdot \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h+\frac{\partial \omega }{
   \partial p} =0

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \theta }{\partial t}
   + \mathbf{\nabla }_{p}\cdot (\theta \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h)
   + \frac{\partial (\theta \omega)}{\partial p}
   = -k_{\theta}[\theta-\theta_{eq}]

where :math:`\vec{\mathbf{v}}_h` and :math:`\omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt}` are
the horizontal velocity vector and the vertical velocity in pressure
coordinate, :math:`\zeta` is the relative vorticity and :math:`f` the
Coriolis parameter, :math:`\hat{\mathbf{k}}` is the vertical unity
vector, :math:`\rm{KE}` is the kinetic energy, :math:`\Phi` is the geopotential, and
:math:`\Pi` the Exner function
(:math:`\Pi = C_p (p/p_c)^\kappa` with :math:`p_c = 10^5` Pa). Primed variables
correspond to anomaly from the resting, uniformly
stratified state.

As described in :numref:`discret_algorithm`, the continuity equation is integrated vertically,
to give a prognostic equation for the surface pressure :math:`p_s`:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial p_s}{\partial t} + \nabla_{h}\cdot \int_{0}^{p_s} \vec{\mathbf{v}}_h dp = 0

The implicit free surface form of the pressure equation described in
Marshall et al. (1997) :cite:`marshall:97a` is employed to solve for :math:`p_s`;
Vertically integrating the hydrostatic balance gives the geopotential
:math:`\Phi'` and allows one to step forward the momentum equation
:eq:`eg-hs-model_equations`. The potential temperature,
:math:`\theta`, is stepped forward using the new velocity field
(see :numref:`adams-bashforth-staggered`).

Numerical Stability Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The numerical stability for inertial oscillations
(see Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`):

.. math::
    S_{i} = f^{2} {\Delta t}^2
    :label: eg-hs-inertial_stability

evaluates to :math:`4 \times10^{-3}` at the poles, for
:math:`f=2\Omega\sin(\pi / 2) = 1.45\times10^{-4}~{\rm s}^{-1}`, which
is well below the :math:`S_{i} < 1` upper limit for stability.
The advective CFL (Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`) for a extreme maximum
horizontal flow speed of :math:`| \vec{u} | = 90 {\rm m/s}`Â  and the
smallest horizontal grid spacing :math:`\Delta x = 1.1\times10^5 {\rm m}`:

.. math::
   S_{a} = \frac{| \vec{u} | \Delta t}{ \Delta x}
   :label: eg-hs-cfl_stability

evaluates to 0.37, which is close to the stability limit of 0.5.
The stability parameter for internal gravity waves propagating with a
maximum speed of :math:`c_{g}=100~{\rm m/s}` (Adcroft 1995 :cite:`adcroft:95`)

.. math::
   S_{c} = \frac{c_{g} \Delta t}{ \Delta x}
   :label: eg-hs-gfl_stability

evaluates to :math:`4 \times 10^{-1}`. This is close to the linear
stability limit of 0.5.

   pickups (âcheckpoint frequencyâ) to one month. The âtemporaryâ pickup

   (:math:`\theta` and :math:`q`) and momentum (:math:`u,v`)
   respectively. In this case, no filter is applied to active tracers.

   function S2g, see :numref:`shapiro_filter`) that applies to

This line enables the non-linear free-surface part of the code,
which is required for the :math:`p^*` coordinate formulation.

Other Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other files relevant to this experiment are

-  :filelink:`code/apply_forcing.F <verification/tutorial_held_suarez_cs/code/apply_forcing.F>`

-  ``input/grid_cs32.face00[n].bin``, with :math:`n=1,2,3,4,5,6`

contain the code customizations and binary input files for this experiment.
The file :filelink:`apply_forcing.F <verification/tutorial_held_suarez_cs/code/apply_forcing.F>`
contains four subroutines that
calculate the forcing terms (i.e., right-hand side terms) in the momentum
equation :eq:`eg-hs-global_forcing_fv`, :varlink:`EXTERNAL_FORCING_U`
and :varlink:`EXTERNAL_FORCING_V` and in the potential temperature equation
:eq:`eg-hs-global_forcing_ft`, :varlink:`EXTERNAL_FORCING_T`. The
water-vapor forcing subroutine (:varlink:`EXTERNAL_FORCING_S`) is left
empty for this experiment.
The grid-files ``input/grid_cs32.face00[n].bin``, with
:math:`n=1,2,3,4,5,6`, are binary files (direct-access, big-endian
64 bit reals) that contains all the cubed-sphere grid lengths, areas
and grid-point positions, with one file per face. Each file contains
18 2-D arrays (dimension 33 :math:`\times` 33) that correspond to the
model variables: *XC YC DXF DYF RA XG YG DXV DYU RAZ DXC DYC RAW RAS
DXG DYG AngleCS AngleSN* (see :filelink:`model/inc/GRID.h`)
