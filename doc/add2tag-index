o pkg/shelfice,model/src
  - addition of functionality described in Jordan et al (2017), "Ocean-Forced 
    Ice-Shelf Thinning in a Synchronously Coupled Ice-Ocean Model". 
    allows "remeshing" of masks in vertical in response to changing free 
    surface due to ice shelf mass change
  - consists of following new files in shelfice package:
    shelfice_remeshing.F:
      called from forward_step. begins remeshing process at fixed time intervals
    shelfice_update_masks_remesh.F
      called from shelfice_remeshing. checks for cells that are too thick or 
      thin and adjusts R_surf & eta accordingly, updates dynamic arrays
    shelfice_remesh_uvmasks.F 
      updates u- and v-point masks and geom factors, using same alg as 
      s/r ini_masks_etc. called from shelfice_update_masks_remesh
    shelfice_remesh_update_rminsurf.F
      called from shelfice_remeshing. updates Rminsurf to avoid SURF_ADJUST
    shelfice_integr_cont_remesh.F
      re-initialises wvel at end of remeshing process. called by
      shelfice_remeshing
  - following files updated to reflect new arrays, params
    SHELFICE.h
    shelfice_readparms.F
    shelfice_read_pickup.F
    shelfice_write_pickup.F 
    shelfice_init_fixed.F
  - model/src/forward_step.F: to add call to shelfice_remeshing if 
    #define ALLOW_SHELFICE_REMESHING	
  - pkg/shelfice/shelfice_init_depths.F: to reflect change made in 
    verification_other/shelfice_remeshing experiment
  - pkg/shelfice/shelfice_thermodynamics.F: to allow different formulation of 
    ustar, set via CPP directive SHI_USTAR_TOPDR
  - pkg/shelfice/shelfice_thermodynamics.F: to make use of real fw flux even 
    with shelficeBoundaryLayer
  - pkg/shelfice/shelfice_forcing_surf.F: to make use of real fw flux even with 
    shelficeBoundaryLayer
  - verification/shelfice_remeshing/*: new verification experiment
    to test remeshing functionality
