    Notes on tags used in MITgcmUV
    ==============================

o AIM: use true log-P extrapolation for near surface temp (= as in 
    F.Molteni paper) ; update aim.5l_cs output.

checkpoint50g_post
o merged with release1_p17 (pkg/seaice and verification/lab_sea)
  - added SEAICE_MULTILEVEL for 8-category sea-ice thermodynamics
  - LSR sea-ice dynamic solver moved to SouthWest B-grid location and
    made the default because of faster convergence than ADI

checkpoint50f_post
o exf totally restructured
  - replaced all exf_set_ routines by one generic exf_set_gen.F
    and made sure it's still differentiable
  - split exf_getffields.F into new exf_bulkformulae.F
  - exf_inscal_/exf_outscal_ suffixes consistent with field names
  - updated adjoint/makefile and relevant verif. accordingly

checkpoint50f_pre
 o AIM: near surface temp evaluated from Pot.Temp: fixed for Part Cell ;
      + change Evap over land. (update aim.5l_cs output)
 o added missing .cvsignores and made uniform across expts
 o changed configuration of tidal_basin_2d expt
 o added pkg/debug functions for tracing code in fatal crashes
 o tidied pkg/monitor to use MONITOR_OPTIONS.h
 o new fn in pkg/monitor to stop model if solution grows too big
 o removed lots of single quotes from comments

checkpoint50e_post
o make KPP work with PTRACERS
 - fix gad_calc_rhs to call new routine kpp_transport_ptr, which is
   nearly a copy of kpp_transport_s
 - there is no analogue to SurfaceTendencyS, so I have to use 
   gPtr(of the surface layer) instead
o add a new platform SunFire+mpi (SunFire 15000) to genmake
checkpoint50e_pre

checkpoint50d_post
o change kpp output from multiple-record state files to single-record state 
  files analogous to write_state.F
o reduce the output frequency of cg3d-related stuff to the monitor frequency, 
  analogous to the cg2d-related output. 
o fix small problem with in ptracers_write_checkpoint.F: len(suff)=512, 
  so that writing to internal file fn (with length 512) fails.
checkpoint50d_pre

checkpoint50c_post
o fix problem in ini_procs.F when using MPI (was there since checkpoint48f)
o add monitor diagnostic of vorticity (mon_vort3.F) and potential energy.
o add time-average diagnostic of U*V and vertical diffusive flux for theta.
o bug fixed in convective adjustment diagnostic (multi-tile set-up).
o 4th Order Adv scheme: return to previous (c40pre7) masking near boundaries.

checkpoint50c_pre
Merging from release1_p13:
o bug fix for pkg/seaice dynamic solver
o Added SEAICE_initialHEFF to pkg/seaice

checkpoint50b_post
o store u*,v* in gU,V instead of in guNm1,gvNm1
o in order to put the momForcing out of the Adams-Bashforth:
  move forcing & CD-scheme calls from mom_fluxform & mom_vecinv
  to timestep.F
o new flag "useCDscheme" (default=F); replace guCD,gvCD by local arrays
o re-generate output for highly sensitive test-exp:
   global_ocean_pressure, ideal_2D_oce, lab_sea, natl_box

checkpoint50b_pre
o restore the use of momAdvection & useCoriolis flags (mom_vecinv)
o corrected CPP option mismatch in exf_Bulk... functions for case 
  #define ALLOW_ATM_WIND && #undef ALLOW_ATM_TEMP

checkpoint50a_post
o Bug fix for merging between c50 and KPP.
  ikey was passed from thermodynamics to kpp_calc via
  common block rather than being recomputed in kpp_calc,
  in contradiction with new key itdkey.
  New key ikppkey created, and tamc.h headers updated.

checkpoint50
- 2nd step of merge with ecco-branch:
  merge changes in ecco-branch back into main trunk
- bug fix in find_alpha
- more storing in gmredi_calc_tensor.F, kpp_routines.F
- avoid iterative loop in ini_pressure for ALLOW_AUTODIFF_TAMC
- merged some sliced AD support routines

checkpoint49
merged from ecco-branch:
o exf:
  - Enable initialisation of forcing fields to constant 
    (runtime) values.
  - in exf_getffields.F
    Reduce i-/j-loop to interior domain, discarding overlaps.
    That also fixes wrong TAF-key computations for key_1, key_2
    with bulf formulae.
  - exf_init.F modify #ifdef for exf_init_evap
  - exf_getffieldrec.F, ctrl_getrec.F
    The following INT-usages are not safe:
      fldsecs  = int(fldsecs/fldperiod)*fldperiod
      fldcount = int(fldsecs/fldperiod) + 1
    and were modified.
o autodiff: checkpoint_lev...
  - updated storing for bulk formulae (some arrays were missing)
  - added state for seaice package
  - synchronized with main branch
o DIVA:
  Modif.s in
  - the_main_loop.F
  - the_model_main.F
  and added cost_final_restore.F cost_final_store.F
  o With these changes, it is possible to fully separate
    the first forward run to compute the cost function (mdthe_main_loop)
    and adjoint runs over individual DIVA intervals (adthe_main_loop)
    into separate model executions.
    This enables better tuning of DIVA to given queue sizes.
  o Loss of cost function value in consecutive DIVA runs is
    fixed by storing to 'costfinal' file.
  o Appropriate call of ctrl_unpack/_pack,grdchk_main at 
    beginning/end of adjoint integration is accounted for.
  The current changes apply to TAF-1.4.26.
  TAF has one remaining bug, requiring one manual change
  (see MITgcm manual).
o cal: synchronized between MAIN and ecco-branch

checkpoint48i_post
o Changes to restore differentiability of code w.r.t. previous tag
  (mostly adding new routines to make list and replacing
  pressure by totPhiHyd).
o Updated and merged grdchk package
  - has both ADM and TLM checks
  - works for single- and multi-proc.
  - output cleaned
  - worked successfully for parallel DIVA
o genmake:
  - Adding -platform=SP4
  - Modif. for DEC Alpha (many don't have makedepend; use mkdep instead).
o Modif. for DIVA:
  ctrl_unpack should not be called in intermediate DIVA interval.
  (similar thing would apply for active files such as
  tbar, sbar, psbar, which should not be reinitialised;
  only relevant for ecco-branch)

checkpoint48h_post
o improve "ini_p_ground" when using finite difference form for calc_phi_hyd
o Added net flux to downward flux conversion to pkg/exf/exf_getffields.F
o Added SEAICE_initialHEFF to pkg/seaice
o ecco_the_model_main.F: SEAICE_WRITE_PICKUP must precede WRITE_CHECKPOINT

checkpoint48g_post
--- EOS:
o compute locally the pressure for use in EOS: UNESCO, JMD95P, MDJWF
  store total Potential in totPhyHyd for diagnostics & EOS.
o fix restart and overlap Pb when using Z-coord and EOS funct. of P
--- Pressure/geopotential gradient:
o use Ro_surf & R_low instead of hFac in cal_phi_hyd:
o NLFS + p-coord.: eta*Alpha' is not longer lagging 1.time-step behind
  ( changes results of global_ocean_pressure )
o NLFS + z-coord.: add eta*Rho' contribution.
o accurate phiHyd when using interface-W at the middle between 2 centers
 ( changes results of ideal_2D_oce )
o includes r* 2nd term in potential gradient.

checkpoint48f_post
Merging from release1_p12:
o Modifications for using pkg/exf with pkg/seaice
  - improved description of the various forcing configurations
  - added basic radiation bulk formulae to pkg/exf
  - units/sign fix for evap computation in exf_getffields.F
  - updated verification/global_with_exf/results/output.txt
o Added pkg/sbo for computing IERS Special Bureau for the Oceans
  (SBO) core products, including oceanic mass, center-of-mass,
  angular, and bottom pressure (see pkg/sbo/README.sbo).
o Lower bound for viscosity/diffusivity in pkg/kpp/kpp_routines.F
  to avoid negative values in shallow regions.
  - updated verification/natl_box/results/output.txt
  - updated verification/lab_sea/results/output.txt
o MPI gather, scatter: eesupp/src/gather_2d.F and scatter_2d.F
o Added useSingleCpuIO option (see PARAMS.h).
o Updated useSingleCpuIO option in mdsio_writefield.F to
  work with multi-field files, e.g., for single-file pickup.
o pkg/seaice:
  - bug fix in growth.F: QNET for no shortwave case
  - added HeffFile for specifying initial sea-ice thickness
  - changed SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FLUXES wind stress implementation
o Added missing /* */ to CPP comments in pkg/seaice, pkg/exf,
  kpp_transport_t.F, forward_step.F, and the_main_loop.F
o pkg/seaice:
  - adjoint-friendly modifications
  - added a SEAICE_WRITE_PICKUP at end of the_model_main.F

checkpoint48e_post
o New S/R for diagnostic of bottom pressure (phi0surf was missing in c48d_post)
o dynamics: change definition of computational domain & adapt mom_fluxform
  accordingly ; when viscA4=0, allows to run the dynamics with Olx=Oly=2. 
o following exp works with Olx=Oly=2 (and pass through checkbounds option):
    adjust_nlfs.cs-32x32x1 adjustment.128x64x1 adjustment.cs-32x32x1
    exp0 exp1 exp2 exp4 exp5 hs94.cs-32x32x5 hs94.128x64x5 hs94.1x64x5
    global_ocean.90x40x15 global_with_exf global_ocean_pressure 
    inverted_barometer solid-body.cs-32x32x1
  (high order AdvScheme and/or multiDimAd works with Olx=Oly=2 ? not sure)

checkpoint48d_post
o in preparation for r*:
 a) use pre-computed gradient of hydrostatic potential:
    changes in timestep.F & mom_cdscheme.F affects results of ideal_2D_oce
 b) move phi0surf from calc_phi_hyd to calc_grad_phi_hyd:
    => affects results of glob_oce_pressure (different truncation error)  
  update output.txt of ideal_2D_oce & global_ocean_pressure

checkpoint48d_pre
o in preparation for r*:
  new S/R (calc_grad_phi_hyd.F) to compute Hydrostatic potential gradient.
  pass the 2 comp. of the grad. as arguments to momentum S/R.
  but for the moment, only used if it does not change the results. 
o add finite volume form of calc_phi_hyd for buoyancyRelation OCEANIC & OCEANICP

checkpoint48c_post
Modifications in treatment of initial flux forcing controls
to avoid extra storing of flux fields.

checkpoint48c_pre
o Added tidal_basin_2d experiment (currently 1D!)
o can use r* Coordinate with OBC (but Orlanski Rad. BC not yet implemented) 

checkpoint48b_post
o r* coordinate added in #ifdef NONLIN_FRSURF block.
 (modification to pressure gradient not yet implemented)
o mom_fluxform: new S/R mom_calc_rtrans.F computes vertical transports
  (for U & V) that are used for vertical advection of momentum.

checkpoint48a_post
o In preparation for r*, use temp. array to compute vertical transport
   in flux-form momentum pkg. => change results of few test-exp. 
  Update output of: exp4, exp5, front_relax, global_ocean_pressure, 
                    lab_sea, natl_box & plume_on_slope

checkpoint48
o fix small bug that was causing lot of warning (TIMER_STOP 'UPDATE_CG2D')

checkpoint47j_post
o add new exp. (ideal_2D_oce) to test "exotic" parameters and options.
o moved adexch from forward_step to addummy_in_stepping
o added exch in ctrl_map_...
o aveFreq.=0. at end of cost_final to avoid overwrite in
  reverse checkpointing loop
o Yet more changes in gmredi:
  * adgmredi_calc_tensor
    avoiding all recomputation of gmredi_slope_limit
  * adgmredi_x/y/rtransport
    added flag for excessive storing to avoid recomp. of
    u/v/rtans, dTdx/y/z
    -> this is not really necessary and very memory-consuming
  * adgmredi_slope_psi:
    consistency with gmredi_slope_limit in treatment of GM_slopeSqCutoff
  * gmredi_slope_limit
    re-activated full calculation of taperfct for case 'ac02'
o updating verification/ adjoints of carbon, global_ocean.90x40x15

checkpoint47i_post
o GM_EXCLUDE_() replace GM_TAPER_(): by default, all the code is compiled.
o add GM_Small_Number & GM_slopeSqCutoff as run-time parameters (data.gmredi)
  default values = 1.D-12 & 1.D+48 (=> give same results as checkpoint47f_post)
o cg2dTargetResWunit: define tolerance using deltaTmom (and not deltaTfreesurf) 
o gmredi: fix few bugs.

checkpoint47h_post (duplicate tag for PH's c48 tag, in order to move c48)
This will be a good checkpoint to plug into the ecco-branch.
o few modif.'s to get latest version adjointed
  (mainly kick out code in ini_linear_phisurf)
o modif's to run adjoint with exactConserv
o case GM_BOLUS_ADVEC should be cleaned
  S/R gmredi_slope_psi should be cleaned
o verification/carbon now has exactConserv=.TRUE.

checkpoint47g_post
o time-average AIM output: becomes independent from statvars time-average
  (can be used with #undef ALLOW_TIMEAVE) ; add new variables (e.g., RH)
o After TAF bug fix:
  Tested adjoint of gmredi package.
  Tests were done with checkpoint47 rather than with latest
  checkpoint47f_post since the latter is broken for the adjoint
  verification/carbon/ contains both ADM and TLM gradient checks.
Here they are, before they get changed/lost/stolen.
Mostly modif.'s to fix numerical sensitivities.
Gradient checks OK for
- GM_taper_scheme:
  * clipping
  * ac02
  * linear
  * glw91
  * dm95
  * ldd97
- GMREDI_OPTIONS:
  * GM_VISBECK_VARIABLE_K
  * GM_NON_UNITY_DIAGONAL
  * GM_EXTRA_DIAGONAL
  * GM_BOLUS_ADVEC
in conjunction with data.gmredi parameters to be checked in
in a few minutes under verification/carbon/code/

checkpoint47f_post
Merging from release1_p10:
o modifications for using pkg/exf with pkg/seaice
  - pkg/seaice CPP options SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FORCING
    and SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FLUXES
  - pkg/exf CPP options EXF_READ_EVAP and
    EXF_NO_BULK_COMPUTATIONS
  - usage examples are Experiments 8 and 9 in
    verification/lab_sea/README
  - verification/lab_sea default experiment now uses
    pkg/gmredi, pkg/kpp, pkg/seaice, and pkg/exf

checkpoint47e_post
o created a tag prior to creating a branch

checkpoint47d_post
o fixed bug in the oceanic pressure coordinates code: vertical viscosity 
  at the bottom boundary had an erroneous half slip boundary condition
o added bottom drag and no slip boundary condition capabilities to 
  oceanic pressure coordinates code
o added new verification experiment global_ocean_pressure, this experiment is
  also described in the tutorial section of the manual
checkpoint47d_pre

checkpoint47c_post
o Added a verification experiment for a global cubed-sphere ocean run
  -  verification/global_ocean.cubed32x32x30
  -  uses pkg/therm_seaice and pkg/bulk_forcing

o allow to run AIM physics with SPEEDY input files (from Franco Molteni)
o allow a more accurate definition of Ro_Surf (selectFindRoSurf=1)
  when using P-coordinate; only implemented for atmospheric config.
o OCEANICP & realFreshWater: include P-E direct effect on wVel ;
  NOTES: requires option NONLIN_FRSURF to be "#define".
o update advect_xz/results/output.txt (left from checkpoint44g_post)

checkpoint47b_post
Merging from release1_p9:
o pkg/seaice
  - removed GOTO's and added taf directives
  - double precision constants to reduce the g77 (Linux)
    to F77 (SGI) differences reported in release1_p8
o tools/genmake
  - added SGI options
o verification/testscript
  - updated to that of checkpoint47a_post
o verification/global_ocean.90x40x15/input/eedata
  - modified for SGI f77 compatibility
o verification/lab_sea
  - added description of sea-ice model
  - added missing matlab routines
  - added test of thermodynamics parallelization

checkpoint47a_post
o new pkg: aim_v23 
 = F. Molteni atmos.physics (SPEEDY, ver23) adapted to MITgcm. 
   for now, keep the same surface forcing as before.
 - Part-Cell implemented into AIM; check that Heat & Water are conserved
 - aim.5l_cs: use new aim pkg (run 10yr & get better results than before)
 - aim.5l_LatLon & aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel are still using old aim pkg
o add diagnostic of surface correction term in monitor output

o bulk_force and therm_seaice 
- Two packages:  bulk_force (Bulk forcing)
  and therm_seaice (thermodynamic_seaice) - adopted from LANL CICE.v2.0.2
- Earlier integration from Stephaine Dutkiewicz
  and Patrick Heimbach.
- Two ifdef statements for compile time,
   ALLOW_THERM_SEAICE and ALLOW_BULK_FORCE

checkpoint47
differentiable version of checkpoint46n_post
o bug fix in quasihydrostaticterms
o * "clean" adjoint code (in terms of extensive recomputations)
    can now be obtained for all GMREDI options (i.e. for 
    - GM_VISBECK_VARIABLE_K
    - GM_NON_UNITY_DIAGONAL
    - GM_EXTRA_DIAGONAL
    - GM_BOLUS_ADVEC )
  * However, wrong gradient check problem remains unsolved.
  * New CPP options have been introduced for different
    tapering schemes
o external_fields_load now part of differentiation list
o pressure needs multiple storing;
  would be nice to have store_pressure at beginning or
  end of forward_step, e.g. by having phiHyd global (5-dim.)
  (NB: pressure is needed for certain cases in find_rho,
  which is also invoked through convective_adjustment).
o recomputations in find_rho for cases 
 'JMD95'/'UNESCO' or 'MDJWF' are OK.
o #define ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING should be differentiable
o ini_forcing shifted to begining of initialise_varia
o Incorporating QNVS line search routines into MITgcm
  (this is separate code, and therefore not under pkg)
  lsopt/, optim/
o Updated verification/carbon/
  - #define GM_VISBECK_VARIABLE_K
  - GM_taper_scheme    = 'ldd97'    

checkpoint46n_post
Merging from release1_p8:
o verification/natl_box:
  updating new external_fields_load routine
o New package: pkg/seaice
  Sea ice model by D. Menemenlis (JPL) and Jinlun Zhang (Seattle).
  The sea-ice code is based on Hibler (1979-1980).
  Two sea-ice dynamic solvers, ADI and LSR, are included.
  In addition to computing prognostic sea-ice variables and diagnosing 
  the forcing/external data fields that drive the ocean model, 
  SEAICE_MODEL also sets theta to the freezing point under sea-ice.
  The implied surface heat flux is then stored in variable 
  surfaceTendencyTice, which is needed by KPP package (kpp_calc.F and 
  kpp_transport_t.F) to diagnose surface buoyancy fluxes and for the 
  non-local transport term.  Because this call precedes model 
  thermodynamics, temperature under sea-ice may not be "exactly" at 
  the freezing point by the time theta is dumped or time-averaged.
  N.B.: fairly large differences in accuracy occur across
        different platforms/compilers; comparison between
        g77 (Linux) and F77 (SGI Origin 2000/MIPSpro) 
        generated output gives:
   T           S           U           V
  C D M    c        m  s        m  s        m  s        m  s
  n p a R  g  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .  m  m  e  .
  f n k u  2  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d  i  a  a  d
  g d e n  d  n  x  n  .  n  x  n  .  n  x  n  .  n  x  n  .

  Y Y Y Y  5  5  7  7  7  8 10  9  6  6  6  6  7  5  7  5  7 FAIL  lab_sea
o GAD: 
  - generated new common blocks to account for call of
    same gad routines with differing traceridentities
    (needed to modify tracerIdentity indices in GAD.h)
  - generated separate common blocks for case useCubedSphereExchange
    (Department of Futurology)
  - parameter lists to gmredi_?transport: added tracerIdentity
  - added new key indices to tamc.h
o external_fields_load:
  - added this routine to TAF list
  - needed to make some common blocks global and additional storing
    along the same lines as exf package (checkpoint_lev?_directives.h)
o exf:
  updated external forcing package
  - bug fixes carried over from ecco-branch
    (missing OBCS_OPTIONS.h in two routines)
  - enable easy to use "no forcing".
  - added exf I/O for atmospheric loading
  - added exf I/O for runoff data
  - transfered scaling between exf <-> MITgcm to exf namelist
o Adding new verification experiment global_with_exf.
  This verification experiment is almost identical to the
  global_ocean.90x40x15 experiment, except that it uses
  the exf (and cal) package instead of the
  external_fields_load routine (cf README file).

checkpoint46m_post
o modified testscript to return -- when there are no lines of "%MON" output 
o added new flag "quasiHydrostatic" for QH mode
  and new routine quasihydrostaticterms()
o added 2*Omega*Cos(phi)*W to u equations (non-hydrostatic Coriolis term)
  New routine: mom_u_coriolis_nh()
o fixed sign of non-hydrostatic metric terms in u and v equations.
  Depend on correct sign of gravitySign.
o added work.pc* to .cvsignore in aim directories using ifc
o introduced flag for controllin non-hydrostatic metric terms
o removed gravitySign from PARM04
o switched to g77/ifc from pgf77 in aim experiments

checkpoint46l_post
o made convective adjustment work with pressure coordinates:
 - changed the direction of k-loop in convective_adjustment.F for the
   case of pressure coordinates (OCEANICP,ATMOSPHERIC buoyancyRelation)
 - adjusted the reference pressure k-index in convective_adjustment.F
 - adjusted the convection condition in convect.F (in analogy to
   calc_ivdc.F)
 - convective_adjustment no longer computes anything on the halos
 - removed the warnings about negative salinity from find_rho.F and
   find_alpha.F; instead the new routine look_for_neg_salinity, called
   at the beginning of find_rho, find_alpha, and find_beta, does a 
   check of the entire slice, if CPP-option 
   CHECK_SALINITY_FOR_NEGATIVE_VALUES is defined
checkpoint46l_pre

checkpoint46k_post
o fixed the verification/global_ocean.90x40x15 experiment:
 - new bathymetry (the world according to A., JMC, and M.)
 - new initial fields and forcing fields (*.bin files)
 - new POLY3.COEFFS (for the next release one should switch to a full
   equation of state: JMD95P or MDJWF)
 - fixed several errors and redundancies in the data file
 - experiment uses looped cells
 - added matlab directory with diagnostic scripts for plotting of output

o S/R aim_initialise.F replace S/R aim_init from file aim_do_inphys.F:
 - read AIM physics parameters from a file (data.aimphys)
 - set defaults values = F.Molteni paper (Clim.Dyn., 2002)

checkpoint46j_post
o split calc_exact_eta in 2 S/R : integr_continuity & update_etaH
o move wVel computation at the end of the time step, in S/R integr_continuity
o create specific S/R to exchange T,S before DYNAMICS (for stagger time step)
o update timeave pkg for wVel diagnostic.
checkpoint46j_pre

checkpoint46i_post
o Clean up AIM package (and keep the results unchanged):
  include CPP_OPTION and use IMPLICT NONE in all routines ; 
  declare all the variables _RL ; use _d 0 for all numerical constants.
  use ifdef ALLOW_AIM everywhere. And now AIM can be used with g77 !

checkpoint46h_post
o cleaned up the use of rhoNil and rhoConst. 
  - rhoNil should only appear in the LINEAR equation of state, everywhere 
    else rhoNil is replaced by rhoConst, e.g. find_rho computes rho-rhoConst
    and the dynamical equations are all divided by rhoConst
o introduced new parameter rhoConstFresh, a reference density of fresh 
  water, to remove the fresh water flux's dependence on rhoNil. The default
  value is 999.8 kg/m^3
o cleanup up external_forcing.F and external_forcing_surf.F
  - can now be used by both OCEANIC and OCEANICP
checkpoint46h_pre

 Added code to convert surface volume flux (fresh water) into
 a mass flux when using P coordinates in the ocean (OCEANICP).
 Note: It assumes you have set rho0=rhoConst=density of fresh water.

checkpoint46g_post
o Include a new diagnostic variable phiHydLow for the ocean model
  - in z-coordinates, it is the bottom pressure anomaly
  - in p-coordinates, it is the sea surface elevation
  - in both cases, these variable have global drift, reflecting the mass
    drift in z-coordinates and the volume drift in p-coordinates
  - included time averaging for phiHydLow, be aware of the drift!
o depth-dependent computation of Bo_surf for pressure coordinates 
  in the ocean (buoyancyRelation='OCEANICP')
  - requires a new routine (FIND_RHO_SCALAR) to compute density with only 
    Theta, Salinity, and Pressure in the parameter list. This routine is 
    presently contained in find_rho.F. This routine does not give the
    correct density for 'POLY3', which would be a z-dependent reference
    density.
o cleaned up find_rho
  - removed obsolete 'eqn' from the parameter list.
o added two new verification experiments: gop and goz
  (4x4 degree global ocean, 15 layers in pressure and height coordinates)
checkpoint46g_pre

checkpoint46f_post
o Enable tangent linear (forward mode) gradient checks:
  - extended active file handling to g_... files
  - added TANGENT_SIMULATION to theSimulationMode
  - extended grdchk package accordingly
o added tangent linear setup in verification/carbon/code_ftl
o added adjoint setup in verification/front_relax/code_ad

checkpoint46e_post
o Added new equation of state -> MDJWF
  - EOS of McDougall et al., 2002, JAOT, submitted
  - caveat: the equation of state is only valid for a smaller (more
    realistic?) range of values than JMD95P/Z and UNESCO
  - added masks to the calculation of pressure in store_pressure
  - added more check values for density in check_eos (ini_eos.F), some of 
    the old check values are out of the range of the MDJWF-eos, so don't
    expect perfect matches for those 
checkpoint46e_pre

checkpoint46d_post
o fixed store_pressure to work with both buoyancy relation = 'OCEANIC' and
  'OCEANICP', also initialised field pressure correctly in ini_eos in the 
  case of pressure coordinates. eosType='JMD95Z' in 
  combination with buoyancyRelation='OCEANICP' now causes an error.
o Changed p = pressure(i,j,k,bi,bj)  to  p = pressure(i,j,kRef,bi,bj)
  in find_alpha/beta.
checkpoint46d_pre

  mdsio_writelocal - same as mdsio_writetile except works for local
                     arrays
  write_local_r? - higher-level wrapper for mdsio_writelocal
  Controlled by diagFreq. Defaults to zero (ie. no dumps)
  Example given at end of mom_vecinv.F that dumps some local arrays.
o replaced calc_mom_rhs.F by mom_fluxform.F/mom_vecinc.F to
  control flux-form versus vector invariant code.
  Switch is runtime flag vectorInvariantMomentum (defaults to false)
  or genmake -DISABLE ...
o TAMC-related update to cope with mom_fluxform.F/mom_vecinc.F
  (additional storing is now needed for case vecinv;

  change (sorry but we've been putting this one off for about 2 years)
  + natl_box, aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel and aim.5l_zon-ave were
    *not* regenerated since they are already out of date and I don't
    want to create the impression that they are suddenly working.
o removed KAP stuff for DEC's
o modified/added many .cvsignore files in */code and */input
o added new expt "solid-body.cs-32x32x1"
  + this uses an alternative form of ini_curvilinear_grid.F which

   cal: calendar
   exf: external forcing
   ecco: essential routines to control use of cal, exf
         (NB: this is not the full ECCO environment)
 o disabled some packages by default in genmake

checkpoint38
 o see notes_c37_adj.txt
 o corrected wrong layer index in external_forcing_t
 o replaced the_main_loop/forward_step by the_main_loop

   (replaced criteria for initial/final state)
 o added runtime flag for pre-C35 pickups: usePickupBeforeC35

checkpoint37
 o mdsio.F routine split and packaged in pkg/mdsio
   (mdsio.F and mdsio_gl.F still exist in eesupp/src but are not
    used unless genmake -disable=mdsio)
 o allow a more precise surface-geopotential gradient for the atmosphere
   taking into account the change in space of Alpha (=1/rho) at the surface.
 o variable "etaN" (replace cg2d_x) is the surface R-anomaly [r unit]
   (ocean: sea surface height [m] / atmos: surface pressure anomaly [Pa])
 o Change units: Phi_Hydrostatic (=phiHyd), Phi_Surface(=cg2d_x) and
   Phi_NonHydrostatic (=cg3d_x), all have now the dimension of a potential
   [m2/s2] (pressure/rhoConst in the ocean ; Geo-Potential in the atmosphere).
 o Time-Average diagnostics defined as a pseudo package "timeave".
 o pickup files : old pickup (before c35) did not work with new code (c35
   and after) unless activating 2 commented lines in initialise-varia.
 o Non-Hydrostatic pickup file Pb fixed.
 o bug with Rigid-lid version (since c35) fixed.  

checkpoint36

checkpoint33
 o Fixed bug in lower BC in impldiff.F
 o Fixed confusion about units of forcing arrays in FFIELDS.h
   namely Fu,Fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR:
   - Removed verification/natl_box/code/external_fields_scale.F
     (did not differ from that in model/src)
   - Changed units of fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR back to proper units
     (see FFIELDS.h for description)
   - Scale fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR when used in external_forcing_surf.F,
     kpp_calc.F and kpp_transport_t.F
   - Removed model/src/external_fields_scale.F and calls to it
   - verification/natl_box uses flux data with "atmospheric" sign so
     a special version of external_fields_load.F is used to
     change the data as it's read in. This way, the arrays
     have the right units and signs at all times tha a user could
     possibly use them.
 o Corrected genmake to delete a temporary file during configuration

checkpoint32
 o Scaling of forcing fields moved from external_forcing.F to
   external_fields_scale.F, called directly after loading fields.

   -> new: external_forcing_surf.F
 o Change of variable names useGMRedi, useKPP, useECCO
 o Further changes in dynamics.F, impldiff.F for TAMC

   except the argument declarations. This was using up some memory.
 o fixed macros like _ADT to work with both versions of Linux cpp
 o cleaned up some unused and uninitialized variables
   (helps when debugging with strict compile options)

   (macros are now in eesupp/inc/CPP_EEMACROS.h)
 o patch for 2 processor JAM mode

checkpoint25

 of KGM time-averaging diagnostic errors. Also contains
 a double-gyre experiment setup as well as the baseline
 4 degree global template. The double gyre template is
 organised to allow it to be applied automatically to
 the baseline configuration.

branch-point-rdot
 A few tidy-ups have been made bt the real point of this
 check-point (excuse the pun) is to allow a branch to be
 made for the purposes of adding the rDot alterations.
 I don't want to commit the rDot to the main-trunk until
 we've actually tested it...
