    Notes on tags used in MITgcmUV
    ==============================

checkpoint6
 Created by cnh
 merged checkpoint5 with CD and 
 spherical polar code. 
 Still some problems with GM Redi
 abd full topography.

checkpoint5
 Created by AJA
 contains updates to GM Redi
 and reordered timestepping loop
 for Implicit Diffusion.

checkpoint4
 Created by cnh
 Contains memory saving macros ( _rdxc etc..) for when
 grid variations are limited.
 Contains polynomial coeffs for EOS and knudsen program
 for generation.

checkpoint3
 Created by cnh
 Added extra flags for runtime options
 Added this file
 Added implicit free-surface
 Added pre-conditioner
 Put compare01 into repository ( compare01/... )
 Put data and eedata into repository ( verification/exp1 )

checkpoint2
 Created by AJA
 Added GM/Redi

checkpoint1
 Created by AJA
 Restructured kloop in dynamics.F
 Added non-linear EOS

baseline
 Original checked in code
