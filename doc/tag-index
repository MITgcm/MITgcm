    Notes on tags used in MITgcmUV
    ==============================

checkpoint14
 Consistent isomorphism chages made. These allow dynamical core
 to support both pressure and meters as a vertical coordinate.

checkpoint13
 Release which corrects global_max problem and a couple
 of KGM time-averaging diagnostic errors. Also contains
 a double-gyre experiment setup as well as the baseline
 4 degree global template. The double gyre template is
 organised to allow it to be applied automatically to
 the baseline configuration.

branch-point-rdot
 A few tidy-ups have been made bt the real point of this
 check-point (excuse the pun) is to allow a branch to be
 made for the purposes of adding the rDot alterations.
 I don't want to commit the rDot to the main-trunk until
 we've actually tested it...

checkpoint12
 Tidy up and added generic genmake script (formerly
 configure script). 
 Released to testers.

checkpoint11
 Re-arranged initialise() and introduced ini_vertical_grid()
 and ini_masks_etc().

checkpoint10
 Introduced the configure script.
 Separated out the diags package.
 Added template for writing time-averages of tile/intermediate quantities.
 Updated SIZE.h in exp2 and made the data big-endian.

checkpoint9
 MPI fix. Filename changes (meta/data). salbin*y stuff.
 General tidy-up.
 SST.bin SSS.bin added to verification/exp2

checkpoint8
 Inludes time-dependant forcing and time-averaging.
 Works at 4x4 and 2.8125x2.8125 global

checkpoint7-4degree-ref
 Branch from checkpoint7. Released for application to
 global modeling and general modeling - process studies, regional
 model etc.. 
 Configured for verification/exp2 - 4 degree global, two process.

checkpoint7
 Created by cnh
 Simple 4 degree global simulation 
 configuration.
 Includes climatological wind, 
 hydrography, bathymetry etc
 Does not include Heat Flux and E-P

checkpoint6
 Created by cnh
 merged checkpoint5 with CD and 
 spherical polar code. 
 Still some problems with GM Redi
 abd full topography.

checkpoint5
 Created by AJA
 contains updates to GM Redi
 and reordered timestepping loop
 for Implicit Diffusion.

checkpoint4
 Created by cnh
 Contains memory saving macros ( _rdxc etc..) for when
 grid variations are limited.
 Contains polynomial coeffs for EOS and knudsen program
 for generation.

checkpoint3
 Created by cnh
 Added extra flags for runtime options
 Added this file
 Added implicit free-surface
 Added pre-conditioner
 Put compare01 into repository ( compare01/... )
 Put data and eedata into repository ( verification/exp1 )

checkpoint2
 Created by AJA
 Added GM/Redi

checkpoint1
 Created by AJA
 Restructured kloop in dynamics.F
 Added non-linear EOS

baseline
 Original checked in code
