      <title>Prerequisites</title> <para>To develop for MITgcm project
      you will need a UNIX or UNIX-like set of build tools including
      the following:</para>
      <blockquote>
	<simplelist type="inline">
	  <member>CVS client</member>
	  <member>make or (preferably) GNU make</member>
	  <member>FORTRAN compiler</member>

	  <member>PERL</member>
	  <member>LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML</member>
	</simplelist>
      </blockquote>
      <para>Essentially all of the work described here has been tested
      on recent versions of Red Hat Linux (eg. 7.3 through 9).  Except
      where noted, all shell commands will be provided using bash
      syntax.

      <title>Layout</title>

      <para>Unlike many open source projects, the MITgcm CVS tree does
      not follow a simple "src", "docs", "share", and "test" directory
      layout.  Instead, there are multiple higher-level directories
      that each, to some extent, depend upon the presence of the
      others.  The tree currently resembles:</para>

      <title>Branches</title>

      <para>As shown in the online <ulink
      url="http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm/model/src/forward_step.F?view=graph">
      ViewCVS-generated tree</ulink>, the MITgcm codebase is split into to two
      branches or "lines" under which development proceeds.  These two lines are
      referred to as the "MAIN" and "ecco" versions of the code.  While not
      identical, the bulk of the MAIN and ecco lines are composed of files from
      the same codebase.
      </para>

      <para>Periodically, a "Release" branch is formed from the "MAIN"
      development branch.  This is done in order to create a relatively stable
      reference point for both users and developers.  The intent is that once a
      relese branch has been created, only bug-fixes will be added to it.
      Meanwhile, development (which might "break" or otherwise render invalid
      the documentation, tutorials, and/or examples contained within a release
      branch) is allowed to continue along the MAIN and ecco lines.</para>
    </sect2>

      <title> Developer settings </title>

      <para>CVS is a convenient tool to keep up-to-date a personal copy of the 
      MITgcm code (see: <ulink url="http://mitgcm.org/public/using_cvs.html"> 
      using CVS </ulink>). The same tool is used by developers to 
      incorporate any change into the repository. However, this later
      function requires specific settings, as detailed here after:</para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para> You will need an account (loggin access) to the server 
           "mitgcm.org" with the proper group setting (e.g.,
            group "gcmctrb" to add/modify code into MITgcm_contrib).
            This kind of account is granted only upon well motivated request.
            The access to the server mitgcm.org is through ssh-key authorization
            which will need to be set properly on both side (on your local machine
            and on your server account). You need to be able to
            to ssh to mitgcm.org (or <filename>ssh MY_USER_NAME@mitgcm.org</filename> 
            in case of different user-name on both sides) to proceed further.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> You need to register to the 
        <ulink url="http://mitgcm.org/mailman/listinfo/mitgcm-cvs"> 
      mitgcm-cvs </ulink> mailing list.
          This ensures that other developers will receive email notification 
           when you make changes; you will also receive as well such email 
           when others make changes to the repository.
          </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> It is highly recommended that you register also to the 
        <ulink url="http://mitgcm.org/mailman/listinfo/mitgcm-devel"> 
      mitgcm-devel </ulink> mailing list (expect a short delay for
       this request to be processed).
          This list is intended for developer discussions.
          </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> The standard anonymous mode (using "cvsanon", as mentionned
        <ulink url="http://mitgcm.org/public/source_code.html"> 
      here </ulink>) does not allow check-in ("cvs commit") permission.
         Instead, you will need to set our CVS environment as follow:</para>
<screen>
  $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
  $ export CVSROOT=':ext:MY_USER_NAME@mitgcm.org:/u/gcmpack'
</screen>
	  <para> After downloading a directory, e.g.: <filename>myCopy</filename>,
           from the CVS repository (e.g.,
            <filename>MITgcm_contrib/thisPart</filename>) using the command:</para>
<screen>
  $ cvs co -P -d myCopy MITgcm_contrib/thisPart
</screen>
	  <para> the type of CVS environment which has been used 
	   is stored in the file <filename>myCopy/CVS/Root</filename> 
           and makes it difficult to re-use, for cvs-commit purpose, 
           a cvs local copy (<filename>myCopy</filename>) which was obtained 
           using the CVS anonymous mode.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> At this stage, you should be able to send your modified source 
          file (e.g., <filename>src_file</filename>) from your local copy directory 
	  (<filename>myCopy</filename>) to the CVS repository
          (<filename>MITgcm_contrib/thisPart</filename>) using the command
          "cvs commit":</para>
<screen>
  $ cd myCopy
  $ cvs -n update        (optional; check if new changes have been made)
  $ cvs diff src_file    (optional; list your changes)
  $ cvs commit src_file
</screen>
	  <para> It is essential that you provide a short description of the 
          changes you made to <filename>src_file</filename> as you check-in 
          this file (the "cvs commit" command automatically opens your standard 
          editor for this purpose).</para>
	</listitem>

      </orderedlist>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Main code development</title>
      <para>(formerly named "Tagging" ; this section needs an update)</para>

      <para>The intent of tagging is to create "known-good" checkpoints that
      developers can use as references.  Traditionally, MITgcm tagging has
      maintained the following conventions:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Developer checks out code into a local CVS-managed directory,
	  makes various changes/additions, tests these edits, and eventually
	  reaches a point where (s)he is satisfied that the changes form a new
	  "useful" point in the evolution of the code.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The developer then runs the <ulink
          url="http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm/verification/testreport">
          testreport</ulink> shell script to see if any problems are introduced.
          While not intended to be exhaustive, the test cases within the
          verification directory do provide some indication whether gross errors
          have been introduced.
          </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Having satisfied him- or herself that the changes are
	  ready to be committed to the CVS repository, the developer
	  then:</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>adds a "checkpointXY_pre" comment (where X is a checkpoint
	      number and Y is a letter) to the <ulink
	      url="http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm/doc/tag-index">
	      tag-index</ulink> file and checks it into the CVS
	      repository</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>submits the set of changes to the CVS repository and adds
	      comments to <filename>tag-index</filename> describing what the
	      changes are along with a matching "checkpointXY_post" entry</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The result of this tagging procedure is a sequence of development
      checkpoints with comments which resembles:</para>

<programlisting>
checkpoint50e_post
o make KPP work with PTRACERS
 - fix gad_calc_rhs to call new routine kpp_transport_ptr, which is
   nearly a copy of kpp_transport_s
 - there is no analogue to SurfaceTendencyS, so I have to use 
   gPtr(of the surface layer) instead
o add a new platform SunFire+mpi (SunFire 15000) to genmake
checkpoint50e_pre

checkpoint50d_post
o change kpp output from multiple-record state files to single-record state 
  files analogous to write_state.F
o reduce the output frequency of cg3d-related stuff to the monitor frequency, 
  analogous to the cg2d-related output. 
o fix small problem with in ptracers_write_checkpoint.F: len(suff)=512, 
  so that writing to internal file fn (with length 512) fails.
checkpoint50d_pre
</programlisting>

      <para>This information can be used to refer to various stages of the code
      development.  For example, bugs can be traced to individual sets of CVS
      checkins based upon their first appearance when comparing the results from
      different checkpoints.</para>

    <sect2 id="build_tools">
      <title>Build Tools</title>

      <para>Many Open Source projects use the "GNU Autotools" to help streamline
	the build process for various Unix and Unix-like architectures.  For a
	user, the result is the common "configure" (that is,
	"<filename>./configure && make && make install</filename>") commands.
	For MITgcm, the process is similar.  Typical commands are:</para>

<screen>
  $ genmake -mods=../code
  $ make depend
  $ make
</screen>

      <para>The following sections describe the individual steps in the build
	process.</para>
      
      <sect3 id="genmake">
	<title>The <filename>genmake2</> Utility</title>

	<para><emphasis>Please note that the older <filename>genmake</> is
	    deprecated and will eventually be replaced by <filename>genmake2</>.
	    This HOWTO only describes the newer tool.</emphasis></para>

	<para>The first step in any MITgcm build is to create a Unix-style
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> which will be parsed by
	  <filename>make</filename> to specify how to compile the MITgcm source
	  files.  For more detailed descriptions of what the make tools are and
	  how they are used, please see:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">
		http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html</></para>
	  </listitem>

	    <para><ulink url="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/make2/">
		http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/make2/</></para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Genmake can often be invoked successfully with a command line as
	simple as:</para>

<screen>
  $ genmake2 -mods=../code
</screen>

	<para>However, some systems (particularly commercial Unixes that lack a
	  more modern "/bin/sh" implementation or that have shells installed in
	  odd locations) may require an explicit shell invocation such as one of
	  the following: </para>

<screen>
  $ /usr/bin/sh genmake2 -make=gmake  -mods=../code
  $ /opt/gnu/bin/bash genmake2 -ieee -make=/usr/local/bin/gmake -mods=../code
</screen>

	<para>The genmake2 code has been written in a Bourne and BASH (v1)
	compatible syntax so it should work with most "sh" and all recent "bash"
	implementations.</para>

	<para>As the name implies, <filename>genmake2</filename> generates a
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>.  It does so by first parsing the
	  information supplied from the following sources</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>a <filename>gemake_local</filename> file in the current
	      directory</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>directly from command-line options</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>an "options file" as specified by the command-line option
	      <filename>-optfile='FILENAME'</filename></para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>then checking certain dependency rules (the package dependencies),
	  and finally writing a <filename>Makefile</filename> based upon the
	  source code that it finds.  For convenience within various Unix
	  shells, <filename>genmake2</> supports both "long"- and "short"-style
	  options.  A complete list of the available options can be obtained
	  from:</para>

<screen>
  $ genmake2 -help
</screen>

	<para>The most important options for <filename>genmake2</> are:</para>

	<variablelist>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><filename>--optfile=/PATH/FILENAME</></term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>This specifies the "options file" that should be used for a
		particular build.  The options file is a convenient and
		machine-indepenent way of specifying parameters such as the
		FORTRAN compiler (<filename>FC=</>), FORTRAN compiler
		optimization flags (<filename>FFLAGS=</>), and the locations of
		various platform- and/or machine-specific tools
		(eg. <filename>MAKEDEPEND=</>).  As with <filename>genmake2</>,
		all options files should be written to be compatible with
		Bourne--shell ("sh" or "BASH v1") syntax.  Examples of various
		options files can be found in
		<filename>$ROOTDIR/tools/build_options</>.</para>

	      <para>If no "optfile" is specified (either through the command lin
		or the environment variable), genmake2 will try to make a
		reasonable guess from the list provided in
		<filename>$ROOTDIR/tools/build_options</>.  The method used for
		making this guess is to first determine the combination of
		operating system and hardware (eg. "linux_ia32") and then find a
		working Fortran compiler within the user's path.  When these
		three items have been identified, genmake2 will try to find an
		optfile that has a matching name. </para>

	      <para>Everyone is encouraged to submit their options files to the
		MITgcm project for inclusion (please send to
		<email>MITgcm-support@mitgcm.org</email>).  We are particularly
		grateful for options files tested on new or unique
		platforms!</para>
	    </listitem>

	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><filename>-pdepend=/PATH/FILENAME</></term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>This specifies the dependency file used for packages.  If
	      not specified, the default dependency file is
	      <filename>$ROOTDIR/pkg/pkg_depend</>.  The syntax for this file is
	      parsed on a line-by-line basis where each line containes either a
	      comment ("#") or a simple "PKGNAME1 (+|-)PKGNAME2" pairwise rule
	      where the "+" or "-" symbol specifies a "must be used with" or a
	      "must not be used with" relationship, respectively.  If no rule is
	      specified, then it is assumed that the two packages are compatible
	      and will function either with or without each other.</para>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><filename>-pdefault=PKG</></term>
	    <term><filename>-pdefault='PKG1 [PKG2 PKG3 ...]'</></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This option specifies the default set of packages
	      to be used.  If not set, the default package list will
	      be read from
	      <filename>$ROOTDIR/pkg/pkg_default</>.</para>

	    <term><filename>-adoptfile=/path/to/file</></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This option specifies the "adjoint" or automatic
		differentiation options file to be used.  The file is analogous
		to the "optfile" defined above but it specifies information for
		the AD build process.  The default file is located in <filename>
		$ROOTDIR/tools/adjoint_options/adjoint_default </> and it
		defines the "TAF" and "TAMC" compilers.  An alternate version is
		also available at <filename>
		$ROOTDIR/tools/adjoint_options/adjoint_staf </> that selects the
		newer "STAF" compiler.  As with any compilers, it is helpful to
		have their directories listed in your $PATH environment
		variable.</para>

	  <varlistentry>

	    <term><filename>-mods='DIR1 [DIR2 ...]'</></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This option specifies a list of directories containing
		"modifications".  These directories contain files with names

	<para>The final "make" invokes the C preprocessor to produce the "little

<programlisting>
           MITgcmUV Packages
           =================

  Optional parts of code are separated from
the MITgcmUV core driver code and organised into
packages. The packaging structure provides a mechanism for
maintaining suites of code, specific to particular
classes of problem, in a way that is cleanly
separated from the generic fluid dynamical engine.

 The MITgcmUV packaging structure is describe
below using generic package names ${pkg}.
A concrete examples of a package is the code
for implementing GM/Redi mixing. This code uses
the package name 
*   ${PKG} = GMREDI
*   ${pkg} = gmredi
*   ${Pkg} = gmRedi

Package states
==============

 Packages can be any one of four states, included,
 excluded, enabled, disabled as follows:

 included(excluded) compile time state which
                    includes(excludes) package
                    code and routine calls from
                    compilation/linking etc...

 enabled(disabled)  run-time state which
                    enables(disables) package code
                    execution.

 Every call to a ${pkg}_... routine from outside the package
 should be placed within both a
 #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG} ... block and a
 if ( use${Pkg} ) ... then block.
 Package states are generally not expected to change during
 a model run.

Package structure
=================

o  Each package gets its runtime configuration
   parameters from a file named "data.${pkg}"
   Package runtime config. options are imported
   into a common block held in a header file
   called "${PKG}.h".
   Note: In some packages, the header file "${PKG}.h" is splitted 
   into "${PKG}_PARAMS.h" that contains the package parameters and 
   ${PKG}_VARS.h" for the field arrays.

o  The core driver part of the model can check
   for runtime enabling or disabling of individual packages
   through logical flags use${Pkg}.
   The information is loaded from a
   global package setup file called "data.pkg".
   The use${Pkg} flags are not used within
   individual packages.

o  Included in "${PKG}.h" is a logical flag
   called ${Pkg}IsOn. The "${PKG}.h" header file can be imported
   by other packages to check dependencies and requirements
   from other packages ( see "Package Boot Sequence" section).
   NOTE: This procedure is not presently implemented,
   ----- neither for kpp nor for gmRedi.

CPP Flags
=========

    1. Within the core driver code flags of the form
       ALLOW_${PKG} are used to include or exclude
       whole packages. The ALLOW_${PKG} flags are included
       from a PACKAGES_CONFIG.h file that is automatically 
       generated by genmake2 (see genmake2 section).
       held in-line in the CPP_OPTIONS.h header file.
       e.g.

       Core model code .....

       #include "PACKAGES_CONFIG.h"
       #include "CPP_OPTIONS.h"
         :
         :
         :

       #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
         if ( use${Pkg} ) CALL ${PKG}_DO_SOMETHING(...)
       #endif

    2. Within an individual package a header file,
       "${PKG}_OPTIONS.h", is used to set CPP flags
       specific to that package. It also includes 
       "PACKAGES_CONFIG.h" and "CPP_OPTIONS.h".


Package Boot Sequence
=====================

    Calls to package routines within the core code timestepping
    loop can vary. However, all packages follow a required
    "boot" sequence outlined here:

    1. S/R PACKAGES_BOOT()
            :
        CALL OPEN_COPY_DATA_FILE( 'data.pkg', 'PACKAGES_BOOT', ... )
 

    2. S/R PACKAGES_READPARMS()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_READPARMS( retCode )
        #endif

    3. S/R PACKAGES_INIT_FIXED()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_INIT_FIXED( retCode )
        #endif

    4. S/R PACKAGES_CHECK()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_CHECK( retCode )
        #else
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL PACKAGES_CHECK_ERROR('${PKG}')
        #endif

    5. S/R PACKAGES_INIT_VARIABLES()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_INIT_VARIA( )
        #endif

Package Output
==============
     6. S/R DO_THE_MODEL_IO

        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_OUTPUT( )
        #endif

     7. S/R PACKAGES_WRITE_PICKUP()

        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_WRITE_PICKUP( )
        #endif

Description
===========

      - ${PKG}_READPARMS() 
    is responsible for reading
    in the package parameters file data.${pkg}, and storing
    the package parameters in "${PKG}.h" (or in "${PKG}_PARAMS.h").
    -> called from INITIALISE_FIXED in PACKAGES_READPARMS

     - ${PKG}_INIT_FIXED() 
    is responsible for completing the internal setup of a package. 
    -> called from INITIALISE_FIXED in PACKAGES_INIT_FIXED
    note: 1) some pkg use instead:
             CALL ${PKG}_INITIALISE  ( or the old form CALL ${PKG}_INIT )
          2) for simple pkg setup, this part is done inside ${PKG}_READPARMS

     - ${PKG}_CHECK() 
    is responsible for validating
    basic package setup and inter-package dependencies.
    ${PKG}_CHECK can import other package parameters it may
    need to check. This is done through header files "${PKG}.h".
    It is assumed that parameters owned by other packages
    will not be reset during ${PKG}_CHECK().
    -> called from INITIALISE_FIXED in PACKAGES_CHECK

     - ${PKG}_INIT_VARIA() 
    is responsible for fill-in all package variables with an initial value.
    Contains eventually a call to ${PKG}_READ_PICKUP that will read
    from a pickup file the package variables required to restart the model.
    This routine is called after the core model state has been completely 
    initialised but before the core model timestepping starts.
    -> called from INITIALISE_VARIA in PACKAGES_INIT_VARIABLES
    note: the name ${PKG}_INIT_VARIA is not yet standard and some pkg 
     use for e.g. ${PKG}_INI_VARS, ${PKG}_INIT_VARIABLES, or the old 
     form ${PKG}_INIT

     - ${PKG}_OUTPUT( )
     is responsible for writing time-average fields to output files
     (but the cumulating step is done within the package main S/R).
     Can also contain other diagnostics (.e.g. CALL ${PKG}_MONITOR) 
     and write snap-shot fields that are hold in common blocks. Other 
     temporary fields are directly dump to file where they are available.
     NOTE: 1) the S/R old name ${PKG}_DIAGS is used in some packages 
              but is beeing replaced by ${PKG}_OUTPUT
              to avoid confusion with pkg/diagnostics functionality.
           2) the output part is not yet in a standard form and might still
              evolve a lot.
    -> called within DO_THE_MODEL_IO

     - ${PKG}_WRITE_PICKUP() 
     is responsible for writing a package pickup file when necessary for 
     a restart. (found also the old name: ${PKG}_WRITE_CHECKPOINT )
    -> called from FORWARD_STEP and THE_MODEL_MAIN in PACKAGES_WRITE_PICKUP
