C     production is no longer uniform in grid box -> assumptions
C     which motivate KPP no longer holds -> treat overturn more

C   if defined: Activate pkg/salt_plume only when seaice AREA exceeds
C               a certain value representative of lead opening AND only
C               if seaice growth dh is from atmospheric cooling.
C   if undefined: Activate pkg/salt_plume whenever seaice forms.
