C     *==========================================================*
C     | SIZE.h Declare size of underlying computational grid.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | The design here support a three-dimensional model grid
C     | with indices I,J and K. The three-dimensional domain
C     | is comprised of nPx*nSx blocks of size sNx along one axis
C     | nPy*nSy blocks of size sNy along another axis and one
C     | block of size Nz along the final axis.
C     | Blocks have overlap regions of size OLx and OLy along the
C     | dimensions that are subdivided.
