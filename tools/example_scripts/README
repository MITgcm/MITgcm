Update: 
- testing scripts were no longer maintained here and have been
  removed (around Dec 01, 2018). 
- updated ones can be found in:
   http://wwwcvs.mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm_contrib/test_scripts/
 and can be downloaded using CVS (http://mitgcm.org/public/using_cvs.html)

=====  What is this?  =====

This directory is a collection of scripts and "crontab" entries mostly
intended for automated testing.  These scripts are not intended for
casual users.  If you have any questions about them or would like help
writing one for your system, please contact the folks at:

  MITgcm-support <MITgcm-support@mitgcm.org>

The convention is to name the directories here after the machine (or
"system" or site) where the scripts are known (or were known at one
time) to run.  Directories are used since each system may use multiple
different testing scripts.


=====  Why does it work this way?  =====

We're sorry that testreport does not work 100% automatically on all
MPI systems.  The problem is that the $MPIRUN or equivalent command is
different on almost every system.  Even on a single system, there may
be a variety of different $MPIRUN executables and each one might take
slightly different arguments, etc.  And these $MPIRUN issues are
further complicated by their (often *forced*) interactions with
whatever queueing system is in effect.  Many systems (eg. UCAR/NCAR)
will not allow a user to run any MPI programs--even small
ones--outside of their queueing system.  So the MPI programs *MUST* be
submitted through the queue.

And this means that you have to get all of the queue system details
right including (but not limited to!):

  - $QRUN syntax (PBS vs LoadLeveler vs Condor vs ...)
  - paths to /scratch disks for input and output
  - shells and shell parameters
  - "module" conventions (PATHs)
  - etc-etc-etc...

Unfortunately, these details can vary wildly from one system to the
next and often require per-user customizations.

These example scripts are meant only as templates!
