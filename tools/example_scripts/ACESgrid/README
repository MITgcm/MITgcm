These are the daily MITgcm testing scripts written by Ed Hill and used 
by jmc on the ACESgrid cluster (currently from AO head node). 
The reslts are automatically fed (by email using the mpack program) into 
the MITgcm web site at:

  http://mitgcm.org/testing.html

and the scripts have the following pecularities:

  - many paths are hard-coded

  - the "aces_test_all" script needs an "mpack" binary which 
    can be obtained from the main MITgcm code using:
	(see: MITgcm/tools/mpack-1.6/INSTALL)

      $ cd MITgcm/tools/mpack-1.6
      $ ./configure
      $ make

  - a current copy of MITgcm is checked out using cvs pserver 
    so you will need the corresponding pserver key in your 
    ~/.cvspass which can be obtained (and which only needs to 
    be performed *once*):

      $ cvs -d ':pserver:cvsanon@mitgcm.org:/u/gcmpack' login
      ===> ( enter the CVS password: "cvsanon" )


The files are:

  ao_crontab		result of "crontab -l > ao_crontab" from jmc@ao.csail.mit.edu
  aces_test_all		main script called by cron
    aces_test_gnu_mpi	\
    aces_test_ifc_mpi	+=> MPI test scripts for each compiler
    aces_test_pgi_mpi	/
    aces_test_ifc_mth    => multi-threaded test with intel compiler

------------------------
Old version of the same script but run by Ed Hill :
  itrda_crontab
  itrda_test_all
    itrda_gnu_test_mpi
    itrda_intel_test_mpi
    itrda_intel_test_mth
    itrda_pgi_test_mpi
