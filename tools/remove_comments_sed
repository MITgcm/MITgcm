# This is a growing list of which comments lines to remove from a file
# in order to reduce the file size of ad_input_code.f. The first one is
# for empty lines.
# We want to remove all comments (=lines starting with C,c,*,!), but
# compiler directives also start with a C, in particular
# CADJ/cadj/Cadj/cADJ/!CDIR/!$TAF, and absolutely must remain in the file.

#- A hack for recent OpenMPI (v1.8.8, shipped with FC.23) version of 'mpif.h'
#  which now contains a new header file: mpif-sizeof.h that relies on module
#  "iso_fortran_env", causing TAF to panic ; try to comment out this header file
