UPDATE PH: Patch removed from cvs until we are confident that all changes work.



Background:
------------------------------
Building the adjoint/tangent linear codes of the MITgcm has been restricted to TAF version 2.3.8 since 3 April 2013 (checkpoint64g). On August 6th/7th MITgcm has been updated to be compliant with TAF default behavior ("-v2") and up-to-date TAF version (TAF-2.5.4 as of August 7) when generating adjont/tangent linear code).

Users who check out a fresh copy of MITgcm or perform an update from the repository will automatically receive all required changes. For those users wanting to stick to a specific (older) version of MITgcm, but also seek to use a more recent TAF version, a patch file, MITgcm-TAFv2.patch, is provided. Note however, that MIT does not provide further support regarding this patch.

In case, your local copy of MITgcm does not contain any differences in the list of affected files below, there is a fair chance to successfully apply this patch and get your local copy of MITgcm running with the current TAF version. 

To apply the patch, place the patch file into your toplevel directory of MITgcm, switch to that directory, and enter the following command:

patch -Np1 < MITgcm-TAFv2.patch
