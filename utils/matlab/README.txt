===  mnc_assembly.m  ===

  This utility is available for assembling the data from one or more
  variables contained in multiple MNC tiles (each having their own
  file) into a single NetCDF file.  It understands both "old-style"
  MITgcm exch1 topologies and newer exch2 topologies.  A complete set
  of examples demonstrating the use of this tool on both exch1 and
  exch2 data sets is available from the MITgcm.org CVS server at:

    $ export CVSROOT=':pserver:cvsanon@mitgcm.org:/u/gcmpack'
