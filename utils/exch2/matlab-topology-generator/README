---- Oct 13, 2010 (after checkpoint62l)
 matlab-topology-generator is no longer supported and does not work anymore
 since latest additions to pkg/exch2 (for OBCS) have not been incorporated into
 the matlab scripts.
 example of "data.exch2" file to use are provided in MITgcm/utils/exch2/input/

---- May 12, 2009 (after checkpoint61n)
 fortran code to set-up topology is now part of pkg/exch2, with new parameter
 file "data.exch2". For now, keep a compatile version of matlab-topology-generator
 (writing files "W2_EXCH2_SIZE.h" and "w2_e2setup.F") as back-up solution
 until new code is extensively tested.
------------------

Matlab code to generate topology description for MITgcm cs6 conventions.

o To run start matlab and execute script driver.m
o To set sizes edit lines in driver.m
  - Settings nr, ng, nb are index space sizes for cube grid.
    They are (nr,ng) the two dimensions (in x and y) or the 1rst face
    followed by (nb) the 1rst dimension (in x) of the 2nd face.
    Note - nr, ng and nb do not have to equal, however the
    current physical grid generation software assumes they
    are equal.
  - Settings tnx and tny are the tile sizes ( these correspond to
    snx and sny in SIZE.h ). tnx and tny must subdivide nr, ng and nb
    exactly.
    The product nsx*npx from SIZE.h needs to equal the number of
    tiles created by driver.m
  - Setting mapIO select option for global-IO mapping.
    3 options are implemented:
    mapIO=-1 : old format: put domains 1 after the other in the X direction.
           can waste disk space if cube dimensions (nr,ng,nb) are not equal.
    mapIO= 1 : compact format, 1 domain after the other (mostly in Y direction)
           but needs to fold some domains (face) that are too large.
    mapIO= 0 : compact format (= 1 long line), one domain after the other.
           This format is not yet supported by pkg/mdsio.

The key output from this code is a Fortran header file W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
and one or more Fotran files called e2setup*.F. These are written
by exch2_setup_cs6_print.m. The header file contains the declarations
of the arrays used to describe the index space topology of the cube domain.
The e2setp*.F files contain the code to initialize these arrays.
Two output options ( variable outmode ) are available in
exch2_setup_cs6_print.m. One produces a single file e2setup.F with a driver
routine that calls a setup routine for each tile. For large numbers of tiles
this file can be huge and can cause some Fortran compilers (g77 certainly) to
allocate ridiculous amounts of memory to parse this file. An alternate output
mode produces one file for each tile initialization routine and one file
"e2setup.F" for the driver.  This mode is kinder to the compiler but creates a
visually annoying large number of source files (one for each tile).
