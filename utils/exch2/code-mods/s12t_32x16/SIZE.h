C     |==========================================================|
C     | The design here support a three-dimensional model grid   |
C     | with indices I,J and K. The three-dimensional domain     |
C     | is comprised of nPx*nSx blocks of size sNx along one axis|
C     | nPy*nSy blocks of size sNy along another axis and one    |
C     | block of size Nz along the final axis.                   |
C     | Blocks have overlap regions of size OLx and OLy along the|
C     | dimensions that are subdivided.                          |
