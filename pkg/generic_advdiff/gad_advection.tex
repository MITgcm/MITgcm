\chapter{Generic Advection Diffusion Package}
  
Package ``generic\_advdiff'' provides a common set of routines for
calculating advective/diffusive fluxes for tracers (cell centered
quantities on a C-grid).
  
Many different advection schemes are available: the standard centered
second order, centered fourth order and upwind biased third order
schemes are known as linear methods and require some stable
time-stepping method such as Adams-Bashforth. Alternatives such as
flux-limited schemes are stable in the forward sense and are best
combined with the multi-dimensional method provided in gad\_advection.
  
There are two high-level routines:
\begin{itemize}
\item{GAD\_CALC\_RHS} calculates all fluxes at time level ``n'' and is
  used for the standard linear schemes. This must be used in
  conjuction with Adams--Bashforth time stepping. Diffusive and
  parameterized fluxes are always calculated here.
  
\item{GAD\_ADVECTION} calculates just the advective fluxes using the
  non-linear schemes and can not be used in conjuction with
  Adams--Bashforth time stepping.
\end{itemize}
