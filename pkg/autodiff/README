c   Adjoint support Package for the MITgcmUV
c   =========================================
c
c   Current Version: 0.1.0 (20-Jun-2000)

c
c   General Outline:
c   ----------------
c
c      The directory autodiff only contains pieces
c      of code that are of general use in getting
c      the adjoint or the tangent linear model of
c      a some MITgcmUV setup.
c
c      Such pieces are hand-coded adjoint routines,
c      initialization and finalization of a future
c      autodiff package, flow directives for TAF
c      and header files necessary to include for
c      doing automatic differentiation.

c            - adjoint support routines:
c              * active_file_ad.F (changed subroutine argument list)
c              * adopen_adclose.F (changed subroutine argument list)
c              * adread_adwrite.F (changed subroutine argument list)
c              * adread_adwrite.F (single file name convention with or
c                                without ALLOW_ECCO_OPTIMIZATION)
c
c            - flow directives:
c              * added: print_message.flow, check_exp.flow
c
c            - exch_ad.F:
c              NB: Exchanges have been modified substantially since
c                  exch_ad.F was written.
