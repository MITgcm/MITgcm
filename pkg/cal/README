c     Calendar Package for the MITgcmUV
c     =================================
c
c
c     This calendar tool was originally intended to enable the use of
c     absolute dates (Gregorian Calendar dates) in the ocean general
c     circulation model MITgcmuv. There is, however, a fair amount of
c     routines that can be used independently of the MITgcmuv. After
c     some minor modifications the whole package can be used either
c     as a stand-alone calendar or in connection with any dynamical
c     model that needs calendar dates. Some straightforward extensions
c     are still pending e.g. the availability of the Julian Calendar,
c     to be able to resolve fractions of a second, and to have a time-
c     step that is longer than one day.
c
c     Current version: 0.2.0
c
c     I'm grateful to any suggestions made by users of this tool in
c     order to improve it. Please report bugs and suggestions to:

c
c
c     Here, you find a documentation of the general architecture of this
c     calendar tool and a short description of individual routines. For
c     specific questions on the individual routines please have a look
c     at their headers and of course at their code.

c
c     (0) Basic assumptions for this version of the calendar tool.
c     ============================================================
c
c         It is assumed that the SMALLEST TIME INTERVAL to be resolved is
c         ONE SECOND.
c
c         Further assumptions are that there is an INTEGER NUMBER OF
c         MODEL STEPS EACH DAY, and that AT LEAST ONE STEP EACH DAY is
c         made.
c
c         Not each individual routine depends on these assumptions; there
c         are only a few places where they enter.
c
c         I plan to get rid of these assumptions as soon as possible in
c         an adequate way.
c
c
c     (1) Format of calendar dates.
c     =============================
c
c         In this calendar tool a complete date specification is defined
c         as the following integer array:
c
c           integer date(4)
c
c           ( yyyymmdd, hhmmss, leap_year, dayofweek )
c
c             date(1) = yyyymmdd    <-- Year-Month-Day
c             date(2) =   hhmmss    <-- Hours-Minutes-Seconds
c             date(3) = leap_year   <-- Leap Year/No Leap Year
c             date(4) = dayofweek   <-- Day of the Week
c
c             leap_year is either equal to 1 (normal year)
c                              or equal to 2 (leap year)
c
c             dayofweek has a range of 1 to 7.
c
c               In case the Gregorian Calendar is used, the first
c               day of the week is Friday, since day of the Gregorian
c               Calendar was Friday, 15 Oct. 1582. As a date array
c               this date would be specified as
c
c               refdate(1) = 15821015
c               refdate(2) =        0
c               refdate(3) =        1
c               refdate(4) =        1
c
c
c     (2) Calendar dates and time intervals.
c     ======================================
c
c         Subtracting calendar dates yields time intervals.
c         Time intervals have the following format:
c
c         integer datediff(4)
c
c           datediff(1) = # Days
c           datediff(2) = hhmmss
c           datediff(3) =      0
c           datediff(4) =     -1
c
c         Such time intervals can be added to or can be subtracted from
c         calendar dates. Time intervals can be added to and be
c         subtracted from each other.
c
c
c     (3) Using the calendar tool together with the MITgcmUV.
c     =======================================================
c
c         Each routine has as an argument the thread number that it is
c         belonging to, even if this number is not used in the routine
c         itself.
c
c         In order to include the calendar tool into the MITgcmUV
c         setup the MITgcmUV subroutine "initialise.F" or the routine
c         "initilise_fixed.F", depending on the MITgcmUV release, has
c         to be modified in the following way:
c
c         #ifdef ALLOW_CALENDAR
c         C--   Initialise the calendar package.
c         #ifdef USE_CAL_NENDITER
c               CALL cal_Init(
c              I               startTime,
c              I               endTime,
c              I               deltaTclock,
c              I               nIter0,
c              I               nEndIter,
c              I               nTimeSteps,
c              I               myThid
c              &             )
c         #else
c               CALL cal_Init(
c              I               startTime,
c              I               endTime,
c              I               deltaTclock,
c              I               nIter0,
c              I               nTimeSteps,
c              I               myThid
c              &             )
c         #endif
c               _BARRIER
c         #endif
c
c         It is useful to have the CPP flag ALLOW_CALENDAR in
c         order to switch from the usual MITgcmUV setup to the
c         one that includes the calendar tool. The CPP flag
c         USE_CAL_NENDITER has been introduced in order to enable
c         the use of the calendar for MITgcmUV releases earlier
c         than checkpoint 25 which do not have the global variable
c         *nEndIter*.
c
c
c     (4) Using the calendar tool as a stand-alone program.
c     =====================================================
c
c
c         This will sometime be available.
c
c
c     (5) The individual calendars
c     ============================
c
c         (a) Simple Model Calendar
c
c               This calendar can be used by defining
c
c                  TheCalendar='model'
c
c               in the calendar's data file "data.cal".
c
c               In this case a year is assumed to have 360 days. The
c               model year is divided into 12 months with 30 days each.
c
c         (b) Gregorian Calendar
c
c               This calendar can be used by defining
c
c                  TheCalendar='gregorian'
c
c               in the calendar's data file "data.cal".
c
c         (c) Julian Calendar
c
c               Not implemented yet.
c
c         (d) Julian Days
c
c               Not implemented yet.
c
c         (e) Just the Model's Timestep
c
c               Not implemented yet.
c
c
c     (6) The individual calendar routines
c     ====================================
c
c        The numbering of the routines is used in the error codes
c        that are used to print error messages. See the routine
c        "cal_PrintError" for details.

c      =======================
c
c                     Copy all the routines and headers to the distribution
c                     after you have installed the latter.

c
c                     Add the line
c
c                       #include "CAL_CPPOPTIONS.h"
c
c                     to the routine that calls "cal_Init".
c
c                     Set the parameters in "data.cal" approriately. The

c                     number od time steps you would like to integrate.
c
c                     CAUTION: Be aware of the current limitations of the
c                              calendar (see above).
c
c                     To specify the integration interval in "data.cal"
