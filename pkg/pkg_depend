#  This file contains a terse list of package dependencies that
#  specify which packages either must be or must not be compiled
#  simultaneously.  The format is:
#
#    package0   -package1 +package2 =package3
#
#  where:
#    "-" ==>  must not be compiled together (if conflict --> stop)
#    "+" ==>  must be compiled  (and will be added automatically)
#    "=" ==>  will be added (recommended but no error if disabled)
#
#  The default behavior (that is, nothing specified) assumes that any
#  two packages can be compiled together or independently.

#  needed to compile model/src:
