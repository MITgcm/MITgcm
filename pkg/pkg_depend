#  This file contains a terse list of package dependencies that
#  specify which packages either must be or must not be compiled
#  simultaneously.  The format is:
#
#    package0   +package1 -package2
#  
#  where:
#
#    "+" ==> "must be used" (and will be added automatically)
#    "-" ==> "must not be used"
#
#  The default behavior (that is, nothing specified) assumes that any
#  two packages can be compiled together.
