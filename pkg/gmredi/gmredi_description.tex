Package ``GMREDI'' implements an along isopycnal tensor for mixing tracers
(see Oceanic isopycnal mixing by coordinate rotation, Redi,
Journal of Physical Oceanography, 1982) and provides a parameterization of 
geostrophic eddies 
using the Gent-McWilliams (see Isopycnal mixing in ocean circulation
models, Gent and McWilliams, Journal of Physical Oceanography, 1995) scheme. 
Either the bolus transport or skew flux forms of the Gent-McWilliams scheme 
can be selected as well as a variety of different tapering algorithms.
