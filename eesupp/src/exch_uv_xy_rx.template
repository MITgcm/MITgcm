C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_UV_XY_RX                                  
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, two-dimensional arrays.    
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Driver exchange routine which branches to cube sphere or
C     | global, simple cartesian index grid. Exchange routine is
C     | called with two arrays that are components of a vector.
C     | These components are rotated and interchanged on the 
C     | rotated grid during cube exchanges.

C     === Routine arguments ===
C     Uphi      :: Arrays with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C     Vphi         Note - The interface to EXCH_ assumes that
C                  the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C                  apply.
C     myThid    :: My thread id.
C     withSigns :: Flag controlling whether vector is signed.
      _RX Uphi(1-OLx:sNx+OLx,1-OLy:sNy+OLy,nSx,nSy)

C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.

C     ** NOTE ** The exchange routine we use here does not
C                require the preceeding and following barriers.
C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.
