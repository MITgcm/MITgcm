C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_Z_XY_RX
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, 2-dim zeta coord array.

C     | Branch to correct exchange for particular grid operating
C     | on a zeta coord array.

C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C               Note - The interface to EXCH_RL assumes that
C               the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C               apply.
C     myThid :: My thread id.
      _RX phi(1-OLx:sNx+OLx,1-OLy:sNy+OLy,nSx,nSy)
      INTEGER myThid

C     !LOCAL VARIABLES:
C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.
      INTEGER OLw, OLe, OLn, OLs, exchWidthX, exchWidthY, myNz

C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
