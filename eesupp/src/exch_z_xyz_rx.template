C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C               Note - The interface to EXCH_RX assumes that
C               the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C               apply.

      INTEGER myThid

C     !LOCAL VARIABLES:
C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.
      INTEGER OLw, OLe, OLn, OLs, exchWidthX, exchWidthY, myNz

C     ** NOTE ** The exchange routine we use here does not
C                require the preceeding and following barriers.
C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.
